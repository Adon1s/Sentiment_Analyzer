    "text": "Of the 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Boeing's share price fell the most in 2024.\n\nThe planemaker got off to a worrying start with January's Alaska Airlines blowout.\n\nIts new CEO also had to contend with a seven-week strike that contributed to delivery delays.\n\nBoeing's painful 2024 ended with the planemaker ranking as the biggest loser in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nIts share price dropped 31% last year — the worst of the index's 30 companies, according to Markets Insider data.\n\nThe planemaker was close to avoiding that title as Nike shares fell nearly 30% across the same period. As a whole, the Dow Jones was up 13%, led by Nvidia after its stock more than doubled.\n\nJust days into 2024 it was apparent that it was going to be a testing year for Boeing.\n\nOn January 5, an Alaska Airlines 737 Max lost a door plug in midair. The fact that the plane was delivered 66 days earlier suggested the problem originated with the manufacturer. That was later shown in the National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary report that said the plane left Boeing's factory missing key bolts.\n\nThe incident sparked an overhaul of the company's processes and culture — and a wave of criticism from airline bosses.\n\nRegulators placed Boeing under further scrutiny too. The Federal Aviation Administration limited production of the 737 Max to 38 jets a month. Its administrator, Mike Whitaker, told Reuters last month he expects Boeing to take several months to get up to that number.\n\nIn March, Dave Calhoun stepped down as CEO. He was replaced in August by Kelly Ortberg, an industry veteran who signaled a return to prioritizing engineering over profit.\n\nOrtberg announced plans to be based in Seattle, Boeing's historic home, and visited factories.\n\nStill, the embattled company couldn't stay out of the headlines.\n\nIn September, its Starliner spacecraft returned to Earth uncrewed. The astronauts it took to the International Space Station were supposed to return after eight days, but problems with Starliner meant they are instead set to spend eight months in space.\n\nLater that month, some 30,000 Boeing workers went on strike, hampering production for seven weeks amid tense union negotiations. 737 Max production didn't restart until December.\n\nLate deliveries continued to irritate airline customers. During the strike, Ortberg announced further delays to Boeing's highly anticipated but yet-to-be-certified 777X jet.\n\nThe CEO also said Boeing would lay off 10% of its 170,000 employees.\n\nBoeing's biggest rival, Airbus, has seen its stock rise 14% over the past year.\n\nBank of America analysts estimated that the European planemaker delivered as many as 760 jets thanks to a big end-of-year push — slightly below Airbus' guidance of 770 planes.\n\nAt the end of November, Boeing had delivered less than half that number, at 318 jets.\n\nOrtberg has a plan to help level the playing field, including putting Boeing leaders on factory floors to help change the company's culture.\n\n\"This is a big ship that will take some time to turn, but when it does, it has the capacity to be great again,\" he said in a memo to staff.\n\n\"With the right focus and culture, we can be an iconic company and aerospace leader once again.\"\n\n2025 is set to be a pivotal year for Ortberg's plan to help move the company forward from last year's woes.\n\nNew year, new Boeing?\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

    "text": "Hedge funds scored hefty returns in 2024, when U.S. stocks and the dollar dominated global markets. Despite an election-fueled \"America first\" narrative in the broader market, some diversified funds still notched outsized gains.\n\nTop hedge funds put up big numbers in 2024, which was dominated by U.S. markets that got a jolt from Donald Trump's presidential election victory.\n\nDespite an \"America first\" narrative that helped boost the S&P 500 23% and the U.S. dollar index by about 7% last year, some multi-strategy funds with bets across different asset classes and geographies saw outsized gains.\n\nFor example, Discovery Capital Management soared 52%, a person familiar with the matter said, confirming other reports. The hedge fund declined to comment.\n\nThat builds on top of a 48% surge in 2023, making it one of the best hedge funds on Wall Street that year, according to Bloomberg.\n\nMeanwhile, D.E. Shaw's Oculus, a macro-oriented multi-strategy fund, returned 36.1% in 2024, and the Composite fund, its largest multi-strategy fund, returned 18%, according to a person familiar with the firm’s results. D.E. Shaw declined to comment.\n\nWhile their performance is often compared to the S&P 500's, hedge funds point out that they don't benchmark themselves to the large-cap U.S. stock index and instead seek to hedge against market downside while providing consistent, risk-adjusted gains that aren't necessarily correlated with the S&P 500.\n\nIn addition, hedge funds often employ different strategies across various offerings. Citadel's flagship Wellington multi-strategy fund returned 15.1% in 2024, a person familiar with the matter confirmed, while its Tactical Trading fund returned 22.3%, and its Equities fund scored an 18% gain. Citadel declined to comment.\n\nElsewhere, Millennium Management climbed 15%, according to reports. The hedge fund didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nWith such gains, those funds were on track to outperform their peers. Through the first 11 months of 2024, hedge funds overall averaged a 10.7% return, according to the latest data from PivotalPath cited by Reuters. That's up from a 5.7% average return in the same period in 2023.\n\nAnd among global hedge funds taking long and short bets on stocks last year, the total weighted average return came in at 12.75%, according to a private Goldman Sachs note that was seen by Reuters.\n\n\"It could be argued that 2024 was the year of the stock picker, with equity hedge funds playing dispersion well and really leaning into creative shorting strategies and a careful use of leverage to drive returns,\" said PivotalPath CEO Jon Caplis told Reuters.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

The weak Q4 issuance expectation didn’t appear to materialize, and Opco’s proprietary tracker indicates that issuance bettered expectations, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm forecast that S&P Global’s and Moody’s Q4 Ratings revenues grew 13% and 22% year-over-year, respectively, higher than the consensus estimates of 11% and 7%. It expects Moody’s Street estimates to rise going into the print. However, for the stocks to work on the print and in 2025, the 2025 guidance and results throughout the year have to exceed investor expectations, contends Oppenheimer.\n\nDiscover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener\n\nPublished first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

    "text": "As the Q3 earnings season wraps, let’s dig into this quarter’s best and worst performers in the online retail industry, including Coupang (NYSE:CPNG) and its peers.\n\nConsumers ever rising demand for convenience, selection, and speed are secular engines underpinning ecommerce adoption. For years prior to Covid, ecommerce penetration as a percentage of overall retail would grow 1-2% annually, but in 2020 adoption accelerated by 5%, reaching 25%, as increased emphasis on convenience drove consumers to structurally buy more online. The surge in buying caused many online retailers to rapidly grow their logistics infrastructures, preparing them for further growth in the years ahead as consumer shopping habits continue to shift online.\n\nThe 6 online retail stocks we track reported a strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 2.2% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 0.7% below.\n\nThankfully, share prices of the companies have been resilient as they are up 5.7% on average since the latest earnings results.\n\nFounded in 2010 by Harvard Business School student Bom Kim, Coupang (NYSE:CPNG) is an e-commerce giant often referred to as the \"Amazon of South Korea\".\n\nCoupang reported revenues of $7.87 billion, up 27.2% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 1.4%. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the company with a solid beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates and solid growth in its buyers.\n\n“This quarter we continued the strong momentum we’ve seen throughout this year, delivering robust growth in revenues and margins,” said Gaurav Anand, CFO of Coupang.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the stock is down 16.5% since reporting and currently trades at $22.45.\n\nWe think Coupang is a good business, but is it a buy today? Read our full report here, it’s free.\n\nKnown for its glass tower car vending machines, Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) provides a convenient automotive shopping experience by offering an online platform for buying and selling used cars.\n\nCarvana reported revenues of $3.66 billion, up 31.8% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 5.3%. The business had an exceptional quarter with an impressive beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates.\n\nCarvana achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth among its peers. Although it had a fine quarter compared its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 8.5% since reporting. It currently trades at $189.81.\n\nIs now the time to buy Carvana? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free.\n\nFounded in 2002 by Niraj Shah, Wayfair (NYSE:W) is a leading online retailer of mass-market home goods in the US, UK, Canada, and Germany.\n\nWayfair reported revenues of $2.88 billion, down 2% year on year, in line with analysts’ expectations. It was a slower quarter as it posted a significant miss of analysts’ number of active customers estimates and a decline in its buyers.\n\nWayfair delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth in the group. The company reported 21.7 million active buyers, down 2.7% year on year. Interestingly, the stock is up 7.5% since the results and currently trades at $46.06.\n\nRead our full analysis of Wayfair’s results here.\n\nFounded by Ryan Cohen, who later became known for his involvement in GameStop, Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) is an online retailer specializing in pet food, supplies, and healthcare services.\n\nChewy reported revenues of $2.88 billion, up 4.8% year on year. This result beat analysts’ expectations by 0.7%.

This number topped analysts’ expectations by 4.4%. It was a very strong quarter as it also produced an impressive beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates and a narrow beat of analysts’ number of active customers estimates.\n\nThe company reported 2.63 million active buyers, up 4.7% year on year. The stock is up 28.6% since reporting and currently trades at $33.47.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Revolve here, it’s free.\n\nThanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over.

Packaged foods emerged as a solution offering convenience to the evolving American family, whether it be canned goods or snacks. Today, Americans seek brands that are high in quality, reliable, and reasonably priced. Furthermore, there's a growing emphasis on health-conscious and sustainable food options.

Let’s take a look at how specialty equipment distributors stocks fared in Q3, starting with Richardson Electronics (NASDAQ:RELL).\n\nHistorically, specialty equipment distributors have boasted deep selection and expertise in sometimes narrow areas like single-use packaging or unique lighting equipment. Additionally, the industry has evolved to include more automated industrial equipment and machinery over the last decade, driving efficiencies and enabling valuable data collection. Specialty equipment distributors whose offerings keep up with these trends can take share in a still-fragmented market, but like the broader industrials sector, this space is at the whim of economic cycles that impact the capital spending and manufacturing propelling industry volumes.\n\nThe 10 specialty equipment distributors stocks we track reported a slower Q3.

    "text": "Lowe’s 16.7% return over the past six months has outpaced the S&P 500 by 10.4%, and its stock price has climbed to $248.99 per share. This performance may have investors wondering how to approach the situation.\n\nIs now the time to buy Lowe's, or should you be careful about including it in your portfolio? Get the full breakdown from our expert analysts, it’s free.\n\nDespite the momentum, we're swiping left on Lowe's for now. Here are three reasons why we avoid LOW and a stock we'd rather own.\n\nFounded in North Carolina as Lowe's North Wilkesboro Hardware, the company is a home improvement retailer that sells everything from paint to tools to building materials.\n\nA company’s long-term sales performance signals its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Unfortunately, Lowe’s 3.1% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was sluggish. This fell short of our benchmark for the consumer retail sector.\n\nA retailer’s store count often determines how much revenue it can generate.\n\nLowe's operated 1,747 locations in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, the company has generally closed its stores, averaging 5.7% annual declines.\n\nWhen a retailer shutters stores, it usually means that brick-and-mortar demand is less than supply, and it is responding by closing underperforming locations to improve profitability.\n\nSame-store sales is an industry measure of whether revenue is growing at existing stores, and it is driven by customer visits (often called traffic) and the average spending per customer (ticket).\n\nLowe’s demand has been shrinking over the last two years as its same-store sales have averaged 3.9% annual declines.\n\nLowe’s business quality ultimately falls short of our standards. With its shares topping the market in recent months, the stock trades at 20.1× forward price-to-earnings (or $248.99 per share). At this valuation, there’s a lot of good news priced in - we think there are better stocks to buy right now. We’d recommend looking at CrowdStrike, the most entrenched endpoint security platform.\n\nThe Trump trade may have passed, but rates are still dropping and inflation is still cooling. Opportunities are ripe for those ready to act - and we’re here to help you pick them.\n\nGet started by checking out our Top 9 Market-Beating Stocks. This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 175% over the last five years.\n\nStocks that made our list in 2019 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+2,691% between September 2019 and September 2024) as well as under-the-radar businesses like United Rentals (+550% five-year return).

    "text": "Workers across 21 states welcomed the new year by seeing their hourly minimum wages rise.\n\nThe federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, a rate that has remained unchanged since July 2009. During his presidential campaign, President Biden pledged to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, though that promise never came to fruition.\n\nIn the meantime, states have taken measures into their own hands over the past 15 years.\n\nStarting Jan. 1, 2025, three states — Delaware, Illinois, and Rhode Island — joined the group of states with a $15 minimum wage, thanks to ballot initiatives approved by voters and later signed into law by their legislators.\n\nResidents of Nebraska and Missouri also approved ballot measures that bumped up their minimum wages by over $1.00/hour to $13.50 and $13.75, respectively.\n\nThe other states with minimum wage increases put into effect by their own residents were New York, which now has a $15.50 hourly rate — $16.50 for those working in New York City, Long Island, and Westchester County — and Michigan at $10.56.\n\nIncoming President Trump did not commit to raising the minimum wage on a federal level but did signal a willingness to consider it further.\n\n“I’d want to speak to the governors,” Trump told NBC News. “And the other thing that is very complicated about minimum wage is places are so different. Mississippi and Alabama and great places are very different than New York or California, I mean in terms of the cost of living and other things. So it would be nice to have just a minimum wage for the whole country, but it wouldn’t work because you have places ... where a minimum wage which is at $8 or $9 ... might have very little effect because the cost of living in certain places is really low.”\n\nThere are 20 states, along with the District of Columbia, that adjust their minimum wage on an annual basis according to inflation, though the effective dates are often mid-year rather than at the start of the year.\n\nAlabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Wyoming are the only seven states that either have no minimum wage law on a state level or have one below the federal minimum.\n\n—\n\nAdriana Belmonte is a reporter and editor covering politics and healthcare policy for Yahoo Finance.

    "text": "If you’re planning on listing your home this year, it’s time to think about getting cozy.\n\nMinimalist interiors with gray laminate flooring, shiny silver fixtures, and aggressively neutral paint colors that dominated interior design in the 2010s and early 2020s are no longer drawing in prospective home buyers.\n\nWhat’s working instead, real estate agents and home stagers say: warmer-toned hues, textured elements, and dollops of character like accent walls.\n\n“Buyers no longer really want that modern box that was so popular back in 2015 or 2016,” said Walter Franco Jr., a real estate agent in Los Angeles.\n\nRicci Taylor, owner of Atlanta-based staging and furniture leasing company Everly Design Co., said she’s noticed earthy shades of brown and accent colors like cinnamon and evergreen catching on with clients, along with more rounded furniture silhouettes and textured metals. After spending pandemic lockdowns cooped up in stark spaces, many buyers are now seeking designs that remind them of nature.\n\n“It’s all about that feng shui — bringing the outside in,” Taylor said. “I think you’re going to be seeing more bedrooms, offices, and accent walls being done with these warmer colors.”\n\nCase in point: Paint giant Pantone declared “Mocha Mousse” its 2025 color of the year. The shade is described as “a warming, brown hue imbued with richness” and “answering our desire for comfort.”\n\nJennifer Roberts, a real estate broker at Coldwell Banker Warburg in New York, said her clients are increasingly prioritizing calming, muted wall colors and subtle pops of color that make their homes feel like oases.\n\n“They want to walk into the apartment and shut out the world,” said Roberts, who does most of her business in Manhattan’s Upper East and Upper West Side neighborhoods.\n\nAnother shift: After years of open-concept floorplans dominating, she’s noticed more buyers once again seeking walls. In some cases, apartments with formal dining rooms are winning out over layouts with more casual options like kitchen islands.\n\n“They want distinct rooms,” Roberts said. “It provides more cozy spaces.”\n\nIf you do live in a minimalist box, however, there’s no reason to fear that your home will never sell. Whites and neutrals remain popular in living areas, and simple upgrades like swapping out light fixtures and painting cabinets can enhance a home’s look at a fraction of the cost of a gut renovation, Taylor said.\n\nHanny Jahns, founder and CEO of staging and interior design company Stageasily, said airy, open homes are still sought after in her Las Vegas market. There, many people are favoring modern designs with character, like the work of potter and designer Jonathan Adler, that can be \"a little bit fun and a little bit retro,\" she said.\n\nIn larger homes, she steers clients toward bigger furniture pieces from the likes of Restoration Hardware. But counterintuitively, those oversized pieces can also work in smaller spaces by making them look larger, she said.\n\nAmong buyers, neutral, natural color palettes aren't going anywhere, but she too is avoiding heavily gray looks for now.\n\n\"Gray is kind of becoming the new beige,\" she said. \"People are staying away from that.\"\n\nClaire Boston is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering housing, mortgages, and home insurance.",

    "text": "Booze makers are getting an early hangover after the US surgeon general called for the addition of a warning label to alcoholic drinks.\n\nOn Friday, shares of beer and alcohol giants sank across the board. Diageo (DGE.L) is down 4% and Pernod Ricard (PER.HA) is down nearly 3%, while Molson Coors (TAP) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) are both down 2%. Brown-Forman (BF-B) and Constellation Brands (STZ) are down around 1% each.\n\nEarlier this morning, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy released a 20-plus-page advisory that linked the risk of cancer to drinking alcohol and called for adding a warning label to beer, wine, and spirits like those on cigarette packs.\n\nAs of now, South Korea requires a cancer-specific label on alcohol, while Ireland signed a new law to do so starting in 2026, per Murthy.\n\nAccording to the advisory, nearly 100,000 US cancer cases and 20,000 cancer deaths have been linked to alcohol consumption each year. It noted seven types of cancer were linked, including breast, liver, and colon cancer.\n\nYahoo Finance reached out to Molson Coors, Anheuser-Busch, and Constellation Brands for comment, but did not hear back.\n\nWith President-elect Donald Trump's administration set to take office in 17 days, the true impact of this advisory is up in the air.\n\n\"We're in the middle of changing administrations ... it's unclear how much leg there is to this into the new administration,\" S&P Ratings analyst Christopher Johnson told Yahoo Finance over the phone.\n\n\"If you actually end up with ... warning labels on the products, then that could have a more lasting impact on the growth outlook for the products.\"\n\nJohnson said a drop in alcohol consumption due to health risks is not at the same level as cigarette consumption, which has an \"industrywide view of volume declines.\"\n\n\"We're not there yet in terms of thinking about some kind of structural pressure on [alcohol] volumes related to health risk concerns,\" added Johnson. His team is also looking out for any attempt by the government to curb consumption with taxation (there have been no hints of new taxes so far).\n\n\"When those types of taxes do hit products ... there tends to be a one-time negative impact that then gets lapped and the consumer gets used to the new price point,\" he said.\n\nBump Williams of Bump Williams Consulting expects \"business goes on as usual\" following the news.\n\n\"From the manufacturing side, distributors have already diversified their portfolio well beyond just servicing the Beverage-Alcohol business and the Retailers will simply do as [they're] instructed to do by the law and regulations required in packaging,\" he told Yahoo Finance in an email.\n\nThe advisory is throwing a wrench in an already struggling sector. Challenges up against the industry include a decline in overall US consumption and premium-priced alcoholic beverages under pressure due to weaker consumer discretionary income, Johnson said.\n\nWilliams is also keeping an eye on potential tariffs under Trump that may cause price hikes.\n\nAll six of the alcohol companies mentioned above clocked negative stock performance in the past year, while the S&P 500 jumped 26%. Brown-Forman and Pernod Ricard led the losses with 34% and 31% drops, respectively.\n\nAccording to a Gallop Poll, nearly 60% of US adults say they have an occasion to drink alcohol, down from the historical trend of 63%, which dates back to 1939. A drop in consumption compared to 2022 has weighed on revenue growth, per Statista Market Insights, though overall revenue is up due partially to higher prices and inflation.\n\nMeanwhile, nonalcoholic beverages have been on the rise.\n\n\"Those factors continue to be much more relevant to our outlook for the sector right now than what the news that came out today might have on further pressure on volumes,\" Johnson said, adding that younger generations are \"already consuming less alcohol.\"\n\nSuntory CEO Takeshi Niinami, whose company is behind brands like Jim Bean and various Japanese whiskeys, said the business has to educate consumers that drinking in moderation is key.\n\n\"Heavy drinking is so bad, we have to talk about that,\" Niinami told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid (listen in above). \"moderate drinking is good for you ... you can feel good and bond with your friends ... we have to demonstrate that we are contributing [to] society,\" he said.\n\n—\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

    "text": "Mike Johnson was able to keep his spot atop the US House on Friday while seeming to offer minimal binding concessions to hard-right Republicans who had threatened his path to re-election.\n\nWhat Johnson did offer — in an announcement made just before the vote — was a promise to \"make meaningful spending reforms to eliminate trillions in waste, fraud, and abuse, and end the weaponization of government.\"\n\nIt is a new effort that Johnson says will also include the formation of a new working group of independent experts set to work directly with Elon Musk’s extra-governmental \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE).\n\nIt’s unclear what powers this new working group will have beyond publicizing its findings, but the promise clearly helped put Johnson over the top as the opposition to him slowly dwindled on Friday afternoon.\n\nJohnson was able to prevail in a narrow tally, gaining a bare majority of 218 votes. Hakeem Jeffries of New York was the Democratic choice and gained 215 votes.\n\nAs expected, a Kentucky Republican named Thomas Massie opposed Johnson and voted for Rep. Tom Emmer.\n\nThe proceedings saw moments of last-minute drama when Republicans Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Keith Self of Texas also initially voted for other candidates but then switched their votes after some arm-twisting behind closed doors.\n\nRep. Self told CNN afterward that he switched his vote after being promised concessions to allow House Freedom caucus members to be part of the process to negotiate some of the major bills in the months ahead.\n\nJohnson pledged as the day began that \"I don't make deals with anyone.\"\n\n\"I don't do anything in exchange for a vote other than commit to make this institution work as effectively and efficiently as possible,\" he told reporters as he entered the Capitol Friday.\n\nThe back-and-forth this week ended (for now at least) fears that Johnson would have to offer deep concessions on a range of issues to his right flank in order to maintain power.\n\nSome of the proposed changes might have made it harder for the Republicans to pass legislation in the coming weeks on a range of topics from the border to energy to taxes, as well as the coming debt ceiling deadline.\n\n“It certainly gives us hope and helps allay some fears we had,” offered analyst Ahmed Riesgo, Insigneo’s chief investment officer, in a live Yahoo Finance appearance shortly after the vote.\n\nBut others were more sanguine. Brian Gardner, Stifel’s chief Washington policy strategist, focused on the dissension and noted that some of the chaos \"is a signal about how difficult it is going to be for Republicans to be going forward.\"\n\nHe added that “investors overestimate how much power Republicans have up on Capitol Hill, especially in the House.”\n\nFriday’s vote came after a bumpy week where the dissatisfaction among many of Johnson’s colleagues was evident, a feeling that manifested in a wide array of ideas that could have given conservative Republicans more power in the coming Congress.\n\nOne of the key areas of contention was a 36-page House rules package that Johnson unveiled in recent days by saying its provisions were not up for debate.\n\nA key change in there actually solidifies Johnson by moving the threshold for opponents to oust him from a single member — a clause that former Rep. Matt Gaetz used to oust Kevin McCarthy — to nine members.\n\nAnother controversial change that Johnson was confronted with — but one he repeatedly parried away — was a push to appoint Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican and leader of the hard-line group, as the chair of the powerful House Rules Committee.\n\nIn the end, Roy did not secure any public promise of the seat but voted for Johnson nonetheless.\n\nSuch a move would have undercut Johnson’s power as that committee — traditionally nicknamed the \"Speaker's committee\" — controls access to much of what is voted on on the House floor.\n\nIn his speech Friday after winning the gavel, Johnson said, “This is a momentous time in the history of our nation\" and spoke of the coming Congress's mission to be \"stewards\" of the American Revolution.\n\nJohnson’s quest was aided by Donald Trump. The president-elect endorsed Johnson earlier this week, made calls to lawmakers on his behalf, and then publicly congratulated him Friday afternoon — writing that \"Mike will be a Great Speaker, and our Country will be the beneficiary.\"\n\nThe immediate pressure for a conclusion to this issue came because the selection of a new speaker was needed before the House can take up official 2025 business, most pressingly certifying Trump’s election victory on Monday.\n\nThe issue that has dogged Johnson all week is that a small faction of House Republicans — whose importance was outsized given Johnson’s tight margins — remains upset about how Johnson has handled things like last month’s budget battle, where he ended up relying on Democrats’ votes in the face of GOP divisions.\n\nThe argument from Johnson and his allies all week has been that the realignment of power in Washington set for 2025 will make those issues moot, and that he is the best leader to shepherd through Trump’s agenda.\n\n\"No speaker is perfect, and no one will ever be,\" said Rep. Lisa McClain, the Michigan Republican, in her speech before formally nominating Johnson.\n\nShe added that the goal of the coming Congress is to “make progress” and enact President-elect Trump’s agenda.\n\nThis post has been updated with additional developments.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nEvery Friday, Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Rick Newman, and Ben Werschkul bring you a unique look at how U.S. policy and government affects your bottom line on Capitol Gains.

    "text": "Rivian (RIVN) stock jumped more than 24% Friday as the EV maker reported better-than-expected vehicle sales for its quarter ending Dec. 31.\n\nRivian said Friday that it delivered nearly 14,200 EVs during the fourth quarter, bringing its yearly sales volume to roughly 51,580 electric trucks — within the company's prior guidance. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to deliver closer to 13,400 EVs for the period and 51,000 for the year.\n\nRivian stock had a rough 2024. Shares ended the year down 40% from 2023 and nearly 90% from their all-time high above $100 in the company's high-profile market debut in 2021.\n\nAfter its blockbuster IPO three years ago, the Amazon-backed EV maker has faced a mountain of obstacles: First, it grappled with a shortage of necessary computer chips; then, there was a wider market shift away from electric cars just as competition from mainstay Tesla (TSLA) was heating up. The company has undergone a massive cost-cutting campaign, slashing its workforce in multiple rounds of layoffs starting as early as 2022 and redesigning car components to make production less expensive.\n\nEven with those efforts, Rivian’s operating losses mounted in the past year. In its third quarter last year, Rivian’s revenue fell for the first time since it went public, dropping 35% to $874 million versus the $980 million expected by analysts as the company faced yet another production disruption thanks to a miscommunication with a key supplier.\n\nRivian’s fourth quarter deliveries number released Friday “affirms that supply issues were isolated to Q3,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan wrote in a note to shareholders Friday. Narayan holds a Neutral rating on the stock and sees shares hovering around $12 over the next 12 months. The stock was trading above $16 Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson maintained his Sell rating on Rivian shares, with a price target of just $8, noting Rivian’s “bottom-line losses are likely to continue for the foreseeable future.”\n\nRivian will report its full fourth quarter results on Feb. 20.\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

    "text": "Ford (F) posted a strong fourth quarter US report, one that capped off a strong year for the Dearborn, Mich.-based automaker.\n\nFord said US sales in Q4 rose 8.8% versus a year ago, powered by F-Series sales that jumped 21.1% in the quarter. For the year, Ford reported a 4.2% jump in US sales, totaling approximately 2.079 million vehicles. Ford rival GM posted a 4% jump in 2024 sales, resulting in 2.7 million vehicles sold.\n\nFord shares were up around 1% in midday trade.\n\nF-Series trucks again shouldered the load for Ford, achieving the status of the No. 1 selling truck in America for the 48th straight year.\n\n“The Ford F-Series best illustrates the company’s Freedom of Choice strategy with gas, diesel, hybrid and electric models. All of these F-Series versions saw year-over-year sales growth in the final month of 2024,” the company said in a statement.\n\nFord’s “electrified” segment — or vehicles using both hybrid and fully electric powertrains — jumped 38% in 2024, hitting 285,291 units sold.\n\nFord hybrid sales were the majority of that total, hitting a record 187,426 — up 40% over 2023. Maverick hybrid pickup sales made up nearly one-third of that amount.\n\nFord said each of its EVs set new sales records last year, with Mustang Mach-E totaling 51,745 units sold (up 27%), F-150 Lightning sales hitting 33,510 (up 39%), and E-Transit sales climbing to 12,610 (up 64%).\n\nMustang Mach-E Q4 sales hit a best-ever 16,119 vehicles sold, which Ford said made it the second-best-selling electric SUV behind only Tesla’s Model Y.\n\nThe success of Ford EVs comes as the company continues to lose money in its EV division, having pushed back the opening of some EV factories and canceled upcoming EVs like a full-size three-row SUV.\n\nOn the Lincoln side, the luxury brand saw Q4 sales jump 35.4%, with 2024 sales climbing 28.1%. The Aviator (up 62.3% for the year) and much-hyped Nautilus (up 50.2%) powered the gains.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

    "text": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) led gains among the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks to start the new year after a group-wide sell-off in the last days of 2024. Shares of the AI chipmaker rose 4.5% Friday after gaining roughly 3% the prior day.\n\nThat upswing followed a 4% dip between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve as megacap tech stocks dropped across the board in the absence of a “Santa Claus\" rally, where the stock market typically enjoys a surge between Dec. 24 and Jan. 2. Tesla (TSLA) stock plunged nearly 13% over that time frame, while Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) dropped more than 4%. Meanwhile, Meta (META) and Google (GOOG) fell just under 4%, and Apple (AAPL) dropped 3%.\n\nEven with its December decline, Nvidia shares still ended 2024 up more than 150%. Wall Street analysts have remained bullish on the stock, estimating shares will rise to roughly $173 over the next year from their current level of $138, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nBank of America’s Vivek Arya told Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast Thursday that broader market forces and company-specific issues drove the sell-off in Nvidia stock late last year.\n\n\"What we have seen in the market is a rotation of money from semiconductors to software,\" Arya said, noting that the latter was less exposed to US trade restrictions on goods to and from China. He added that for Nvidia, \"the last two quarters have not been clean, really, because they're going through growing pains from one generation of product that was Hopper to the new generation of product.\"\n\nArya was referring to concerns surrounding delays in shipments of the company's new Blackwell artificial intelligence chips.\n\n\"In our view, these are short-term issues,\" he said. That could create a buying opportunity: While its Magnificent Seven peers are trading at two times their average earnings growth estimates for 2025, Arya noted that Nvidia shares are trading at less than one times the consensus earnings growth for the company this upcoming year.\n\nArya has a Buy rating on Nvidia stock and sees shares rising to $190 over the next 12 months.\n\nShares of Nvidia and its Magnificent Seven peers have benefited from investors' massive bets on artificial intelligence, as well as earnings growth. As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported, through roughly three-quarters of reports, the combination of Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, and Nvidia grew earnings year over year by 33% in 2024, compared to just 4.2% growth for the other 493 S&P 500 companies, per FactSet data.\n\nTo be sure, skeptics warn of a bubble that could burst and send AI-fueled stocks tumbling if hype over the new technology fades and Big Tech's spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure wanes. Wall Street analysts overall remain convinced the AI enthusiasm will continue, however.\n\nTesla also notched a notable gain Friday, jumping more than 8%. Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta rose around 1%, while Amazon spiked nearly 2%. Apple shares were roughly flat.\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

    "text": "President Joe Biden on Friday blocked US Steel’s (X) $14 billion sale to Japanese giant Nippon Steel on national security concerns, creating new uncertainty for an iconic American steelmaker.\n\n\"This acquisition would place one of America’s largest steel producers under foreign control and create risk for our national security and our critical supply chains,\" President Biden said in a statement.\n\nThe stock of Pittsburgh-based US Steel dropped more than 7% in morning trading.\n\nUS Steel and Nippon in a joint statement suggested they would now pursue legal action following Biden's order, which they said did not \"present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making it clear this was a political decision.\"\n\n\"We are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights,\" the companies said in their statement, which argued that Biden's move sent \"a chilling message to any company based in a U.S. allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States.\"\n\nThe 124-year-old US Steel spent much of 2024 lobbying the Biden administration to approve the tie-up, which would have allowed the world’s fourth-largest steelmaker an entry into the US market.\n\nThe Japanese buyer committed to keep the US Steel name and Pittsburgh headquarters, but it couldn’t overcome concerns about the potential effect on union workers, domestic supply chains, and US national security.\n\nThe United Steelworkers union staunchly opposed the deal, arguing it would be bad for steelworkers and harm America's ability to produce steel.\n\nBiden sided with that view in the latest example of a protectionist tilt in Washington from both parties.\n\n\"We need major US companies representing the major share of US steelmaking capacity to keep leading the fight on behalf of America’s national interests,\" Biden said Friday.\n\nBiden was public about his opposition to the deal last year while he was still running for president. President-elect Donald Trump also opposed the acquisition and also vowed to block the deal.\n\nThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a federal interagency panel, spent months reviewing the acquisition for national security risks and was reportedly unable to reach a consensus before sending a report about the matter to Biden.\n\nIn his new executive order issued Friday, Biden is requiring the companies to abandon the deal in 30 days unless the date is extended by CFIUS.\n\nIt’s unclear if US Steel would look to find a new buyer.\n\n\"It's been a highly politicized process,\" Josh Spoores, CRU North American steel analyst, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nUS Steel and Nippon on Friday repeated the commitments they had made previously, including new investments in US Steel plants and ensuring that key directors and executives would be US citizens.\n\n\"The record before CFIUS is abundantly clear that this transaction, with the commitments made by Nippon Steel, would strengthen, not weaken, national security\" the companies said in their joint statement.\n\n\"Yet, it is clear that the CFIUS process was deeply corrupted by politics, and the outcome was pre-determined, without an investigation on the merits, but to satisfy the political objectives of the Biden White House.\"\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

It averaged 6.62% during the same period a year ago.\n\n\"Compared to this time last year, rates are elevated and the market's affordability headwinds persist,\" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s Chief Economist.\n\nMortgage rates have trended higher despite the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates three times since starting its monetary policy easing cycle in September.\n\nThey have risen in tandem with U.S. Treasury yields amid a resilient economy and investor fears that President-elect Donald Trump's proposed policies, including tax cuts, higher tariffs on imported goods and mass deportations, could reignite inflation.\n\nMortgage rates track the 10-year Treasury note. Sales of previously owned homes surged to an eight-month high in November, mostly reflecting contracts signed in October and possibly September when mortgage rates were mostly lower.\n\nSales could still rise in December after contracts increased to a 21-month high in November. Increased supply is pulling more buyers into the market, but rising mortgage rates could discourage some homeowners from putting their houses on the market, especially if they would need to buy another home.\n\nMany homeowners have mortgages below 5%. The so-called rate-lock effect could mean fewer homes being listed, reducing inventory and pushing up prices.\n\nThis would combine with rising mortgage rates to reduce affordability for many prospective buyers.\n\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)",

The increase is occurring with the price of homes rising steadily.\n\nThe average rate on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, popular with homeowners seeking to refinance, climbed to 6.13%, up from 6% and also the highest since July.

However, buyers appear to be more inclined to get off the sidelines as pending home sales rise.”\n\nInterest rates have been climbing since the Federal Reserve signaled last month that it expects to raise its benchmark rate just twice this year, down from the four cuts it forecast in September.\n\nThe reason the Fed is tapping the brakes is that inflation remains stubbornly above the cental bank's 2% target, even though it’s fallen from the heights it reached in mid-2022.

    "text": "Mortgage rates are inching down today — but just barely. According to Zillow, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate has decreased by one basis point to 6.67%, and the 15-year fixed rate is down four basis points to 6.00%.\n\nRates will probably decline throughout 2025, but not drastically. If you're otherwise ready to buy a home, now could be as good a time as any to start house hunting.\n\nDig deeper: Should you buy a house? How to know if you're ready.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\n30-year fixed: 6.67%\n\n20-year fixed: 6.51%\n\n15-year fixed: 6.00%\n\n5/1 ARM: 6.68%\n\n7/1 ARM: 6.65%\n\n30-year VA: 6.08%\n\n15-year VA: 5.63%\n\n5/1 VA: 6.23%\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nLearn more: 5 strategies for getting the lowest mortgage rates\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\n30-year fixed: 6.65%\n\n20-year fixed: 6.62%\n\n15-year fixed: 5.89%\n\n5/1 ARM: 6.04%\n\n7/1 ARM: 6.68%\n\n30-year VA: 6.05%\n\n15-year VA: 5.77%\n\n5/1 VA: 5.97%\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nUse Yahoo Finance's free mortgage calculator to see how various interest rates and term lengths will impact your monthly mortgage payment. It also shows how the home price and down payment amount play into things.\n\nOur calculator includes homeowners insurance and property taxes in your monthly payment estimate. You even have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage to 30-year fixed mortgage rates is mortgage interest — both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed term comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed term, and it’s higher than the intro rate to a 30-year ARM. The higher your rate, the higher your monthly payment. You’ll also pay much more in interest over the life of your loan due to both the higher rate and the longer term.\n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are basically swapped from the 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDig deeper: 15-year vs. 30-year mortgages\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't necessarily reflect this, though — in some cases, fixed rates are actually lower. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nLearn more: Adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage\n\nFirst of all, now is a relatively good time to buy a house compared to the last couple of years. Home prices aren't spiking like they were during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. So, if you want or need to buy a house soon, you should feel pretty good about the current climate.\n\nAlso, mortgage rates aren't predicted to fall drastically throughout 2025 like people were expecting a few months ago. Since rates are wobbling now — and competition tends to be less fierce in winter months — it could be a good time to buy.\n\nRead more: Which is more important, your home price or mortgage rate?\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.67% right now. But keep in mind that averages can vary depending on where you live. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.\n\nMortgage rates are expected to go down overall in 2025, though they probably won't plummet anytime soon.\n\nMortgage rates have been going back and forth for a couple of weeks, and they've ticked down a bit today.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nA rate-and-term refinance replaces your original mortgage with a new one with a different mortgage rate and term length. Find out if it’s a good fit.\n\nWhen you can refinance a mortgage depends on your loan type. You may have to wait up to 12 months. Learn how soon you can refinance your mortgage.\n\nWant to get a mortgage on a $500,000 home? Learn what your monthly mortgage payment and long-term costs will be to determine if you can afford a $500,000 house.\n\nThere are several types of home refinance options, including cash-out, no-closing-cost, and more. Learn which type of refinance is best for your financial goals.\n\nHow do you know when to refinance your mortgage? Lower interest rates are only one sign that it could be time.

Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nWith a new year comes new resolutions, often tied to our personal, health, and financial goals. Many Americans may be looking to save more money, eat healthier, commit to a fitness regimen, or, in some cases, cut out alcohol.\n\nAccording to a 2023 Gallup poll, 62% of US adults drink alcohol. About 1 in 5 adults who drink said they sometimes drink more than they think they should.\n\nToo much alcohol can certainly have negative impacts on your mental and physical health; taking a break from drinking can serve as a much-needed reset. That’s a big part of why “Dry January” is growing in popularity.\n\nBut if you decide to participate this year, you might find that abstaining from alcohol for 31 days could benefit your wallet too.\n\nAfter a festive holiday season, some people feel the need to hit the pause button on their alcohol consumption. Enter Dry January, a challenge officially started in 2013 by Alcohol Change UK, which encourages adults to abstain from drinking alcohol for the entire month.\n\nThe challenge is meant to be a total reset, leading to higher energy levels, increased productivity, improved sleep, and other health benefits. About a quarter of Americans successfully completed Dry January in 2024, according to a survey by CivicScience. That’s up from 16% in 2023.\n\nHowever, resolving to go alcohol-free in January may not only be good for your health — experts say your finances can benefit as well.\n\nRead more: 5 psychological money hacks to cut spending and increase savings\n\n“So many of us think about our physical and mental health at this time of the year; make a resolution to put your financial health in that same bucket,” said Emily Irwin, Wells Fargo senior director of advice, in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “When you think about Dry January, that really means take a step back and only spend on necessities.”\n\nAfter all, the costs associated with drinking extend beyond the price of booze.\n\nAmericans spend an average of $583 on alcohol each year, according to Own Your Limits, an educational campaign run by the Department of Defense. That’s about $50 per month — but it could be more, depending on your alcohol consumption and drink of choice.\n\nThen there are all the other potential expenses involved in a night of drinking: tipping the bartender, a taxi or rideshare home, that late night pizza you probably wouldn’t have ordered if you weren’t buzzed.\n\nThere are also indirect, long-term expenses you might reduce by cutting back on alcohol, such as medical costs or even insurance premiums.\n\nDry January can present a great opportunity to be more mindful of your spending in general. So while you’re at it, take a look at your budget and see if there are other ways you can cut back on unnecessary spending in January and beyond.\n\nRead more: Your complete guide to budgeting for 2025\n\nIf you decide to take on the dry January challenge, there are a few steps you can take to set yourself up for success and get the most out of your alcohol-free month:\n\nPlan out your social calendar ahead of time: Take a look at your plans for this month and identify any potential triggers or social situations where you might be tempted to drink. Come up with a strategy for how to handle them, like meeting up with friends at the local coffee shop rather than a cocktail bar. If you think you may give into temptation, planning ahead and making sure you’re in the right environment can make it easier to stick to your goal.\n\nLet friends and family know you’re taking on the challenge: Give your loved ones a heads up that you’re avoiding alcohol for the month, especially if you feel you might need extra support or an accountability partner.\n\nSwap out your drink of choice for a mocktail: Many bars and restaurants offer alcohol-free versions of your favorite cocktails and other specialty nonalcoholic beverages. Look up menus to find out what nonalcoholic options are available and decide what you’re drinking ahead of time. That way, you can still enjoy going out without breaking your alcohol-free streak.\n\nSet a goal: What will you do with your newfound savings? Choosing a goal — whether it's establishing an emergency fund or saving up for a spring break vacation — can help you stay motivated to stick with Dry January and enjoy the results of your hard work.\n\nCheck in with yourself: Depending on your previous relationship with alcohol, going cold turkey can sometimes lead to negative side effects. Pay close attention to how you’re feeling and note any changes, such as increased anxiety or headaches. You may want to discuss these symptoms with your doctor.\n\nWith interest rates on the decline, redditors want to know which financial institution has the better option for their savings: American Express or Wealthfront. Here’s our expert take.\n\nUnderstanding the relationship between savings/CD rates and inflation can help you maximize your interest earnings. Here’s how inflation impacts savings account and CD rates.\n\nAre CD rates expected to go up or down this year? Here’s what could happen, according to experts.\n\nIf you’re traveling, moving, or otherwise away from your credit union’s nearest branch, shared branching allows you to perform basic banking tasks at a location within the network.\n\nIf you send money using Zelle, it’s important to be aware of transfer limits.

    "timestamp": "2025-01-04 15:33:39",
    "text": "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.\n\nThe proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.\n\nWHAT WAS THE LAWSUIT ABOUT?\n\nThe Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.\n\nApple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words “Hey, Siri,” but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company’s technology.\n\nThe story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.\n\nHOW MANY PEOPLE ARE COVERED BY THE SETTLEMENT?\n\nTens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.\n\nHOW MUCH MONEY WILL EACH ELIGIBLE CONSUMER RECEIVE?\n\nIt's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors: the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.\n\nA claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.\n\nDID APPLE BREAK ANY LAWS?\n\nIf the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial. Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.\n\nAlthough Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a “fundamental human right.”\n\nAlthough $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion — a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.\n\nDO I NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THE MICROPHONES ON OTHER DEVICES SPYING ON ME?\n\nPerhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.\n\nJUST IN CASE, HOW DO I DISABLE SIRI?\n\nYou can turn Apple’s virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:\n\n1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.\n\n2. Toggle off Listen for ‘Hey Siri’ and press the Side button for Siri.\n\n3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.\n\nYou can also disable individual apps' access to your iPhone's mic by doing the following: Navigate to Settings (select the app) then toggle off Microphone.",

    "text": "“Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam. I don’t like it because it’s another currency competing against the dollar.”\n\nQuite so, but this was not the chairman of the US Federal Reserve offering the usual, officially sceptical view of crypto, or even the notoriously anti-crypto Gary Gensler, chairman of America’s financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nNo, it was actually Donald Trump on Fox News back in June 2021. Everyone is entitled to change their mind, I suppose, but Trump’s conversion to the joys of crypto has been positively Damascene; today he calls himself the “crypto president”, and he is stacking his incoming administration with crypto cheerleaders. For crypto fans, it’s been quite literally like a second coming.\n\n“There has been an effort in the Washington bureaucratic swamp to stifle innovation… but President Trump will deliver on his promise to encourage American leadership in crypto,” Brian Hughes, Trump’s transition team spokesman, says.\n\nAs red flags go, there can be few more glaring than this; the promise to further deregulate an asset class that has become a natural home for speculators, crooks, fraudsters, money launderers and drug dealers is almost guaranteed to end badly.\n\nIt is as if the lessons of the gloriously named Sam Bankman-Fried, now serving 25 years in jail for multiple crypto-linked embezzlement, money laundering and political donation violations, have already been completely forgotten.\n\nAnd it’s not just this relatively recent scandal. Significant deregulation of financial markets nearly always eventually results in financial scandal and crisis.\n\nYou can set your watch by it; let finance off the leash and five to 10 years later there will be an almighty explosion, sometimes – as happened in the financial crisis 15 years ago – involving catastrophic collateral damage to the economy and costs to taxpayers.\n\nIt surprises me in some respects that the cycle of financial deregulation has turned quite as quickly as it has given how recent the last experience of disaster was; normally it takes several decades for all institutional knowledge of the previous crisis to be forgotten, allowing policymakers and practitioners to go for broke anew.\n\nBut in Trump, the lobbyists have found a worthy and seemingly easily bought champion, and it’s once more off to the races.\n\nThe president-elect’s crypto policy team is already extensive. The new chairman of the SEC is to be the crypto-friendly Paul Atkins, while the former PayPal chief operating officer and crypto enthusiast David Sacks has been appointed “White House AI and crypto czar”.\n\nTrump’s nominee to head the Council of Economic Advisers, Stephen Miran, is similarly an outspoken critic of regulatory curbs on crypto.\n\nPerhaps most important of all, the president-elect’s nomination for commerce secretary is Howard Lutnick, a big Trump campaign funder with extensive skin in the game via a 5pc stake in Tether, a cryptocurrency stablecoin.\n\nTrump too has clambered aboard the easy money bandwagon, throwing his weight and that of his two sons, Eric and Donald Jr, behind World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture that openly touts customers on the promise of “no direct oversight of any government agencies or officials”.\n\nIt is almost never a good idea for narrow commercial interest and public policy to become so blatantly entangled, but Trump is taking the self-evident potential for conflict of interest to a whole new level.\n\nThere is nothing wrong in principle with the idea of private currencies that compete with the fiat currencies of nation-states. In justification, it can be argued that they help to keep the fiat currency honest by creating an alternative to official means of exchange.\n\nBesides the lure of anonymity, the attraction of crypto is that unlike fiat currencies, which are subject to government and central bank manipulation and devaluation, issuance is strictly capped at a known quantity, or at least supposedly so.\n\nFor obvious reasons, governments tend not to like the competition, and crypto is outright banned in parts of Africa and Asia. But in the West, it has grown like topsy, and following a rapid rebound from the meltdown of 2022, fed by the growing prospect of Trump’s re-election, the total value of crypto assets is now nearly $3.5 trillion.\n\nThat’s a big number, but at around 13pc of annual US GDP, still probably not big enough to be systemically significant or threatening.\n\nIn any case, crypto’s tendency to boom and bust has so far failed to inflict lasting damage on the wider financial system and economy. But that could change, particularly if current restrictions on banking exposure to crypto are lifted, as many of those who helped finance Trump’s election campaign hope.\n\nIt’s payback time, and Trump seems minded to deliver. There’s even talk of creating a national reserve of crypto assets worth tens of billions of dollars, this on the entirely spurious grounds that it could act as a hedge against inflation and that its gains might partially offset the nation’s mountainous debt pile.\n\nAny such reserve may admittedly be no worse than the numerous other ways in which governments squander taxpayers’ money, but it is certainly going to put rocket boosters under an already inflated market if everyone knows there is a backstop buyer with unlimited ability to issue Treasuries to fund its crypto spending spree.\n\nCrypto isn’t made safe just because it carries the president’s stamp of approval. America has a history of this kind of officially sanctioned high-risk nonsense. Don’t forget that Bernie Madoff was once chairman of Nasdaq, and that a trillion dollars’s worth of subprime mortgage-backed securities carried a triple-A credit rating.\n\nIn the latter case, there was at least some kind of asset backing, however poor the quality of the loans. With crypto, there is nothing at all beyond the “greater fool” investment theory. It’s curtains once embedded in the banking system.\n\nIf the whole thing were not so shot through with wealthy men pulling the levers of power to further line their own pockets, it would be almost laughable.\n\nAlso laughable is the attempt to pass crypto off as some kind of technological marvel, and anyone who stands in its way as a backwards-looking luddite incapable of moving with the times.\n\nThe underlying story of crypto is in truth as ancient as finance itself – a 21st-century, high-tech version of bubble mania with no particular utility or purpose other than that of getting in and out before the whole thing once again goes belly up.\n\nThat point may still be some distance off, and who knows, Trump might survive his second term in office without any such a mishap. But I’d be surprised.\n\nCrypto is just part of the president-elect’s much wider deregulatory approach to the hot money of Wall Street, and as I say, where there’s financial deregulation, crisis nearly always follows.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Recent AI progress is thanks to “large-scale infrastructure investments that serve as the essential foundation of AI innovation and use,” Smith wrote.\n\nCloud infrastructure providers like Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc. have been racing to expand computing capacity by constructing new data centers. In the previous fiscal year ending in June 2024, Microsoft spent more than $50 billion on capital expenditures, the vast majority related to server farm construction fueled by demand for artificial intelligence services.\n\nMore: Why Artificial Intelligence Is So Costly to Develop: QuickTake\n\nSmith also cautioned the incoming Trump administration against “heavy-handed regulations” related to AI. “The most important US public-policy priority should be to ensure that the US private sector can continue to advance with the wind at its back,” Smith wrote.\n\nThe country needs “a pragmatic export control policy that balances strong security protection for AI components in trusted data centers with an ability for US companies to expand rapidly and provide a reliable source of supply to the many countries that are American allies and friends,” Smith wrote.\n\nMuch of the spending on data centers goes toward high-powered chips from companies including Nvidia Corp. and infrastructure providers such as Dell Technologies Inc. The massive AI-enabled server farms require lots of power, which prompted Microsoft to strike a deal to reopen a reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, the site of a notorious partial meltdown in 1979.

This might not seem like much, but consider that three years ago, it was just 0.07%, reflecting a sharp rise in a short period of time.\n\nThis is largely due to monetary policy decisions by the Fed, which began raising its benchmark rate in March 2022 to combat skyrocketing inflation.

    "text": "You could be paying more for a new Rolex watch at an authorized dealer in 2025 after used Rolex prices continued falling last year. But rising retail prices could be good news for collectors and secondhand dealers hit hard by Rolex depreciation.\n\nEarlier this week Bloomberg reported that Rolex began the year by hiking prices as much as 8% for some new precious metal timepieces. For instance a gold Day-Date 40-mm with black dial that went for approximately $42,250 last year now will cost you $45,809, according to Rolex’s website. A gold GMT-Master II that went for $42,550 now retails for $45,950, Bloomberg said. Popular Rolex steel sport watches saw modest price hikes as well.\n\nTypically, most jewelers and luxury watchmakers introduce new prices for goods at the start of the year, but an 8% jump is pretty drastic, outpacing inflation. A Rolex spokesperson said the company had no comments to share at this time when Yahoo Finance reached out.\n\nMeanwhile, prices for used Rolex watches, which were higher than retail because most models were not available, have fallen steadily.\n\nOver the past year, the WatchCharts Overall Watch Market index, which tracks a basket of secondhand luxury Swiss and European watches fell 5.1%. Prices paid for the holy trinity of Swiss watches — Rolex, Patek Philippe, and Audemars Piguet — fell 4.9%, 6.5%, and 7.4%, respectively. This follows a rough 2023 when Rolex prices fell 8.2%.\n\nWatchCharts founder and CEO Charles Tian told Yahoo Finance that rising retail prices and continued lack of inventory at the authorized retail level may actually boost demand and prices for the beaten-down secondhand Rolex market.\n\n“I think that long term, it could result in greater demand for pre-owned Rolex watches as their value proposition becomes stronger,” he said.\n\n“Typically, when Rolex implements a price increase, it strengthens demand for pre-owned models, as collectors and first-time buyers seek alternatives that offer value without compromising on quality or prestige,” said Paul Altieri, founder and CEO of Bob’s Watches, one of the largest Rolex secondhand retailers.\n\nTian pointed out that while a new Rolex watch’s retail price has remained unchanged when accounting for inflation, the price of that same watch in the secondhand market has fallen by more than 25% in some instances.\n\n“If Rolex continues to raise retail prices (as they have almost every year this decade) and secondary prices continue to gradually fall, we could see a significant number of former retail buyers opting for pre-owned instead,” Tian said.\n\nThis, in turn, means higher prices and relief for secondhand Rolex dealers like Bob’s Watches, retailers like Watches of Switzerland, and even Rolex’s own certified pre-owned program (and its wholly owned retail subsidiary, Bucherer-Tourneau).\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

    "text": "No one ever wants to look back in regret. But for many retirees, that’s the reality.\n\nNot to be a downer at this fresh start time of year, but it’s useful to hear retirees’ regrets — especially if you’re closing in on retirement yourself.\n\n“Despite improvements in savings habits and financial engagement, many retirees regret some of the decisions they made earlier in life when preparing for retirement,” Suzanne Ricklin, vice president of retirement solutions at Nationwide Financial, told Yahoo Finance. “More than 8 in 10 workers over 45 regret not taking retirement saving more seriously when they were younger.”\n\nHere are five of retirees’ biggest regrets:\n\nFewer than 1 in 4 retirees are very confident they will be able to maintain a comfortable lifestyle throughout their retirement, according to a new report by the nonprofit Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.\n\nThe estimated median household savings among retirees, excluding home equity, in this survey is only $71,000. The estimated median home equity among retirees is $114,000. But 1 in 4 retirees do not have any home equity.\n\nMore than two-thirds of retirees wish they would have saved more and on a consistent basis — and half wish they hadn’t waited so long “to concern themselves with saving and investing for retirement,” according to the researchers.\n\n“Many of today’s retirees lacked the awareness, know-how, and access to resources needed to successfully prepare themselves for retirement,” Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of Transamerica Institute, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n“Their careers began 40 or 50 or more years ago — which was long before the advent of 401(k)s and the societal imperative for people to self-fund a larger portion of their retirement income,” she said.\n\nFor many women, the shortfall stems from a late start. Research from Corebridge Financial found that more than 6 in 10 retired women wish they had started saving for retirement earlier – only about a quarter of them began saving and investing between the ages of 18 and 29. Worse yet, about 4 in 10 retired women say they did not begin prioritizing their financial and retirement planning until 41 or later, and 20% said they still have not started.\n\nWhat?!\n\n“All this points to the importance of saving early in your working years,” Terri Fiedler, Corebridge Financial president of retirement services, told Yahoo Finance. “This came through loud and clear in our survey. Knowing what they know now, this was the No. 1 piece of advice retired women would give their younger selves about retirement planning.”\n\nOne of the biggest gaffes people make when it comes to Social Security is claiming too early at a much lower benefit. You can improve your odds of not outliving your savings by delaying taking Social Security benefits, which will increase your monthly check considerably for decades.\n\nBut many people don’t — or can’t — wait. The median age at which retirees started receiving benefits is 63, according to the Transamerica report. Nearly 3 in 10 retirees started receiving benefits at age 62, which is the earliest age possible, resulting in a much-reduced benefit. Only a slim fraction, 4%, of retirees waited until age 70.\n\nHere’s how the math works. If you have the flexibility to delay benefits, the increase that you get by waiting is substantial. Pushing back tapping your benefits from your full retirement age, or FRA — either 66 or 67 — until age 70, you earn delayed retirement credits. Those come to roughly an 8% per year annual increase in your benefit for each year until you hit 70, when the credits stop accruing.\n\nWhile there are clearly good personal reasons for claiming early, such as poor health or financial constraints, the psychological tug is often what pushes retirees to get their checks rolling earlier rather than later.\n\nPerhaps the biggest factor is the psychological ownership of one’s Social Security benefits, according to Suzanne Shu, a professor of marketing at Cornell University.\n\nNearly half of retirees said that debt was a stumbling block that prevented them from saving for retirement, according to the Transamerica report.\n\nAnd once they retired, almost 7 in 10 reported carrying outstanding credit card debt, per a survey from the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI). That’s up from 4 in 10 four years ago.\n\nAnd one-third said their spending is much higher than they can afford in 2024, nearly double the respondents from 2020.\n\nSometimes the decision to retire is a regret. About one-third of retirees regretted not working longer, according to Olivia Mitchell, co-author of a paper published in the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nThe financial upside of working past the traditional retirement age is clear: more years of earning and saving, not needing to dip into retirement savings so those funds can stay invested and grow, and having the ability to push back claiming Social Security.\n\nSometimes the choice, however, is made for you. More than half of those surveyed by EBRI retired earlier than expected due to reasons beyond their control, such as health problems or disability, or changes at their company, like downsizing, closure, or reorganization.\n\nAlmost 6 in 10 retirees retired sooner than planned, per Transamerica. Only 1 in 5 retired early because they were financially able.\n\nRetirees typically regret not preparing emotionally and having a plan for the transition to retirement and what’s next, Preston Cherry, a certified financial planner, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n“These are having answers to questions such as: What am I going to do next? How am I going to do it? How am I going to reacclimate myself into hobbies and know myself?” he said.\n\n“They regret that it took them so long to give themselves permission to retire, and then to unplug from an identity that they may be used to — whether it be their business or corporate job.”\n\nIn general, retirees are happy, have close relationships with family and friends, are enjoying life, have a positive view of aging, have a strong sense of purpose, and have an active social life.\n\nIn fact, more than 4 in 10 retirees have experienced improvements to their enjoyment of life and happiness since they stepped out of the workforce, Transamerica data found. In addition, many are actually spending more time with family and friends and pursuing hobbies than they had expected would be possible.\n\nOver half of retired women rate their financial health as good or very good, compared to just 38% of those not retired, according to Corebridge’s research.\n\n“One thing that stood out in the data is the fact that retired women are more likely to describe their financial health positively than those still in their working years,” Fielder said. “It’s surprising that many women who have retired from the workforce seem to feel more secure about their finances than women who are still earning a paycheck.”\n\nThe runway ahead is different for all of us, so how to create a life without regrets is not a cookie-cutter endeavor.\n\n“Retirement is highly personal,” Collinson said. “People retire at different ages and for different reasons.”\n\nHave a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note.\n\nHow about this for an intention for 2025: “Retirees with financial regrets should create a written financial plan,” Collinson said.\n\nFactor in living expenses, debt repayment, savings, and investments. Then look at how your asset allocation is divided between bonds, cash, and stocks so that it’s balanced for your risk tolerance, age, and goals. Review sources of guaranteed retirement income, healthcare needs, insurance protections, taxes, and the possible need for long-term care.\n\nAnd don’t forget inflation.\"Many retirees were caught off guard these past few years,\" she said. \"Hopefully, inflation is back under control, but it will always pose a potential risk to retirees and their buying power.”\n\nOnly 19% of retirees have a written plan, she added. “But just because you’re already retired doesn’t mean you can’t do some retirement planning to know where you stand and give yourself a boost.”\n\nKerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

    "text": "Joe Biden calls himself the most pro-union president in American history. But he’s punting a thorny union matter to his successor, Donald Trump, who may not have any better solutions than Biden does.\n\nOn Jan. 3, Biden, as expected, blocked Nippon Steel’s effort to purchase US Steel, the oxidized icon of American industrialization. US Steel has been seeking a buyer or other type of restructuring since 2023, and last year Japan’s largest steelmaker made a $14.9 billion bid for the firm. Shareholders support the deal, but the president has to sign off, given that steel production is important to the US defense industry and a foreign buyer could threaten domestic supplies.\n\nBiden came out against the deal last March, saying US Steel should retain American ownership. Nippon tried to improve its offer by assuring the influential steelworkers union it would protect jobs and keep plants open. The union never bought it. Donald Trump, meanwhile, also came out against the deal last year.\n\nAs the 2024 election heated up, the odds of the Nippon purchase going through grew slimmer — at least until the election was over in early November. Trump, Biden, and Biden’s replacement Kamala Harris were all angling for steelworker votes in bellwether Pennsylvania, US Steel’s home state, and the safest bet for all was to simply oppose the Nippon purchase.\n\nTrump’s victory in November suggested no deal would go through once he became president, since the foreign purchase of a landmark steel producer would violate Trump’s “America First” doctrine. But there was still a chance Nippon could sweeten its offer and Biden might bless the deal during the lame-duck period before Trump took office.\n\nThat would have made business sense — and perhaps been the best outcome for US Steel’s 10,000 unionized workers. Many business analysts think the Nippon offer was the best US Steel could hope for. US Steel is a pipsqueak compared to the global giant it once was. China now makes more than half of the world’s steel, followed by India, Japan, and the United States. Nippon Steel is the world’s fourth-biggest steelmaker, while US Steel is 24th. Since 2010, US Steel has lost money eight years out of 14. Its stock price is down 41% since 2010, while the S&P 500 index is up 433%.\n\nUS Steel started seeking a buyout or other strategic move in 2023 because it doesn’t have the scale to invest in the most modern technology and compete with the world’s biggest players, even excluding state-subsidized Chinese steelmakers. The company says it may have to close unionized plants, lay off workers, and move its headquarters from Pittsburgh to a non-union state if it remains a standalone operator. Some of the company’s union members even support the Nippon deal, an unusual breach between labor leaders and the workers they’re supposed to represent.\n\nThat could have given Biden cover for approving the deal, even if he had to take some heat from the union bosses on his way out the door. Instead, by killing the deal, Biden has left the steelmaker on shaky ground, with hundreds or thousands of jobs vulnerable. “President Biden claiming Japan's investment in an American steel company is a threat to national security is pathetic and craven,” Harvard economist Jason Furman, who was President Obama’s top economist, posted on X. “I'm sorry to see him betraying our allies while abusing the law.”\n\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Bluesky, or sign up for his newsletter.\n\nMany business and political analysts agree that Biden’s national security justification for blocking the deal is a canard. Japan is a close US ally, not a troublemaker nation like China or Iran. And the US defense industry consumes barely 2% of domestic steel production, well below any reasonable threshold for blocking the deal on the grounds that America could run short of steel in a war or other emergency.\n\nBiden isn’t offering a solution for how US Steel can become more competitive and safeguard worker jobs without the Nippon deal. The trend in the industry is toward more automated “minimills” that are cleaner and more efficient but require fewer workers. US Steel has suggested it will move in that direction if it can’t achieve broader scale.\n\nLast year, rival steelmaker Cleveland Cliffs made a lower offer for US Steel than Nippon, yet the union bosses favored that deal because they felt workers would fare better. Cleveland Cliffs has since made another purchase and appears to be out of the running for US Steel. But some analysts think it would be quick to snatch up valuable assets, at the right price, if US Steel started selling off parts of the business. That might only happen after US Steel closes plants and axes workers, however.\n\nTrump says he has a solution: tariffs and tax incentives. Those would make foreign steel more expensive, aiding the domestic industry, while also perhaps providing subsidies for domestic production. The catch is that Trump-style protectionism tends to benefit one class of workers at the expense of others. Or, American consumers simply pay more to cover the higher cost of American labor. When Trump imposed tariffs on imported steel during his first term, for example, steel manufacturers benefited but purchasers of steel, such as automakers and appliance makers, had to pay more and pass along higher costs.\n\nSteelworkers aren’t alone in their quest to maintain job security and living standards amid a rapidly changing economy. Unionized East Coast dockworkers could resume a strike on Jan. 15, sparking a big fight over automation, efficiency, and blue-collar jobs. Port operators want to modernize shipping with machinery that will speed processing and lower costs — and replace many workers. The union wants pay raises and job guarantees, regardless of efficiency. A strike could test Trump’s skills as a “pro-business” president who also wants to protect the blue-collar jobs that were prominent 50 years ago but are growing scarce now.\n\nTrump’s whole “America first” philosophy, in fact, is a pledge to modulate technological progress and globalist efficiency by inserting some circuit breakers that protect jobs and living standards. So maybe Trump will be better than Biden, after all. For steelworkers, that means hoping the devil you don’t know is better than the one you do.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

    "text": "The Supreme Court is starting 2025 with a blockbuster case that will have dramatic implications for one of China’s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nTikTok is making an emergency appeal before the highest court, asking it to block enforcement of a federal law signed by President Joe Biden in April that effectively bans the app on Jan. 19, unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nThe company's arguments that the law should be overturned in the name of free speech will be aired at a hearing on Jan. 10, just 10 days before Donald Trump is sworn in as president.\n\nTrump, who on the campaign trail suggested in a social media post that he would \"save TikTok,\" is asking the court to suspend the divestment deadline and consider his preference for a “negotiated resolution\" — given that as president, he will be responsible for national security.\n\nLate on Friday, the Department of Justice asked the Supreme Court to reject Trump's request, saying no one was disputing that China \"seeks to undermine U.S. interests by amassing sensitive data about Americans and engaging in covert and malign influence operations.\"\n\nA ruling from the Supreme Court to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META), according to Mark Lightner, head of special situations legal research for CreditSights, an independent credit research firm.\n\nOther US tech companies that supply microchips and cloud computing services to TikTok could see a dent in revenue.\n\nThe court may have tipped its hand about how it may rule, Lightner said, when it decided to hold arguments on Jan. 10 rather than first grant TikTok’s request to pause the new law and then hear arguments later in the court’s 2025 term.\n\nOne possible outcome in the coming weeks is that the court will find the law constitutional and let it stand, leaving Congress to deal with it if lawmakers and Trump want to reverse it.\n\n\"It’s possible there were not enough votes to grant a stay a couple weeks ago,\" Lightner said, noting that it takes five justices to implement a stay and just four to take up the dispute.\n\nThe TikTok case will likely be the most prominent corporate case to be argued before the Supreme Court in 2025.\n\nBut there are others the business world will surely be watching, with widespread implications for other key industries.\n\nOne that could have major repercussions for the auto and fuel industries centers on longstanding opposition to how California sets vehicle emission standards, which are tougher than those imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nCalifornia can do this because of an exclusive waiver it was allowed to request from the EPA's Clean Air Act. The EPA allowed the waiver so the state could more aggressively address its smog issues.\n\nValero Energy Corp's Diamond Alternative Energy and other plaintiffs said the EPA's grant of this waiver let the state act as a \"junior-varsity EPA\" and quasi-federal regulator on global climate change.\n\nThe plaintiffs in Diamond Alternative Energy v. Environmental Protection Agency include petroleum and biomass-derived fuel refiners and producers, along with a fuel trade association and 17 states. Automakers Ford (F), Volkswagen (VWAGY), Honda (HMC), BMW (BMW.DE), and Volvo also intervened in the case.\n\nThe case will be closely watched for its potential to impact the shift from fossil fuels to electric vehicles.\n\nThe Court will address whether the petitioners have standing to bring their case, given that the D.C. Circuit Court ruled they were not directly injured by the waiver, and whether the waiver is unlawful.\n\nAnother key question to be considered by the Supreme Court could impact how much companies must pay for labor.\n\nThe case that surfaced this issue, EMD v. Carrera, started with work done by sales representatives at a company (EMD) that distributes food brands.\n\nThese reps said they didn’t receive overtime pay despite working more hours than a normal week. They filed a lawsuit under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and found a lower court willing to rule in their favor.\n\nThe court said EMD followed the wrong standard in classifying the representatives as exempt from minimum wage and overtime pay.\n\nAlthough Congress passed the FLSA, allowing employers to exempt certain workers from overtime pay, including those who work as outside sales reps, the lower court said that a company must show \"clear and convincing evidence\" that a worker is exempt.\n\nEMD has argued that such a bar is too high.\n\nWhether companies can file cases with courts that may be more inclined to favor their views is the subject of another case that will be argued this month before the Supreme Court.\n\nThe case, Food and Drug Administration v. R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co., started with the tobacco maker R.J. Reynolds challenging an FDA ban on flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nIt made the challenge in a New Orleans-based federal appeals court known as the Fifth Circuit, which covers Texas and nearby states and is known for its conservative opinions.\n\nA case against the FDA would normally be filed in Washington or in the area where R.J. is based, which would be the Fourth Circuit. But R.J. joined with sellers of vapes in Texas to file in the Fifth Circuit.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit ruled in R.J.’s favor last year, prompting the FDA to ask for a Supreme Court review.\n\nThe Biden administration's Justice Department argued the ruling from the Fifth Circuit \"facilitates blatant forum shopping\" and \"undermines the precedents of other courts.\"\n\nAnother Supreme Court case that will come before the high court in 2025 could expand or limit the Justice Department's reach to go after financial wrongdoing.\n\nThe case, Stamatios Kousisis and Alpha Painting and Construction v. US, deals with a contractor who deceived the government in an application for a government contract.\n\nThe government argues that federal wire fraud and mail fraud statutes should be interpreted broadly to permit prosecution, even when the government did not suffer financial harm.\n\nDaniel Ahn, a white-collar defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, said if the government's broader interpretation is accepted, it could lead to a larger swath of investigations into corporate conduct and to an increase in criminal and civil prosecutions.\n\n\"If the wire fraud statute is defined very broadly to encompass no financial loss schemes, then that really expands the universe of material that plaintiffs lawyers ... can bring against businesses,\" Ahn said.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Recent AI progress is thanks to “large-scale infrastructure investments that serve as the essential foundation of AI innovation and use,” Smith wrote.\n\nCloud infrastructure providers like Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc. have been racing to expand computing capacity by constructing new data centers. In the previous fiscal year ending in June 2024, Microsoft spent more than $50 billion on capital expenditures, the vast majority related to server farm construction fueled by demand for artificial intelligence services.\n\nMore: Why Artificial Intelligence Is So Costly to Develop: QuickTake\n\nSmith also cautioned the incoming Trump administration against “heavy-handed regulations” related to AI. “The most important US public-policy priority should be to ensure that the US private sector can continue to advance with the wind at its back,” Smith wrote.\n\nThe country needs “a pragmatic export control policy that balances strong security protection for AI components in trusted data centers with an ability for US companies to expand rapidly and provide a reliable source of supply to the many countries that are American allies and friends,” Smith wrote.\n\nMuch of the spending on data centers goes toward high-powered chips from companies including Nvidia Corp. and infrastructure providers such as Dell Technologies Inc. The massive AI-enabled server farms require lots of power, which prompted Microsoft to strike a deal to reopen a reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, the site of a notorious partial meltdown in 1979.

    "text": "ETFs are coming off a year of record growth, with inflows totaling over $1 trillion for the first time.\n\nThe funds have remained popular as investors continue to swap mutual funds for ETFs' tax efficiency and ease of trading.\n\nETF experts say they expect the massive growth to continue, particularly within actively managed funds.\n\nExchange-traded funds are coming off a banner year as investors continue to swap mutual funds for better tax efficiency and the ease of trading of ETFs.\n\nAnnual inflows into US-based ETFs totaled over $1 trillion for the first time ever in 2024, breaking previous records by a landslide to bring the total market to $10.4 trillion as measured by total assets managed.\n\nFunds that track the S&P 500 once again saw the biggest inflows, helped by a sweeping preference for US stocks as the market enters the third year of its bull run, closing out 2024 with a 23% gain for the benchmark index.\n\nUS equities, and the ETFs that track them, got a further boost from Donald Trump's presidential election victory in November as investors priced in corporate tax cuts and a looser regulatory environment. ETF flows swelled to a monthly record of $164 billion in November, according to data from ETFGI, an ETF research and consulting firm.\n\nIn addition to popular index funds, 2024 also saw the creation of the first spot bitcoin ETFs and a boom in leveraged funds catering to risk-on investors looking to amplify the gains in single stocks.\n\nNow, ETF investors and managers hope the party will continue in 2025, and they're largely looking to actively managed funds rather than traditional fixed-income or index-tracking ETFs, sources said.\n\nActive funds surged in popularity last year, taking in $276 billion through November, according to ETFGI data. That makes up nearly a third of all flows for the year and marks a 71% surge from 2023.\n\nActive funds have also dominated new issuance as regulation around ETFs has eased in recent years, accounting fot around 80% of all ETF new launches in the last year, JPMorgan's chief ETF strategist Jon Maier said.\n\nThe trend will likely continue in 2025, especially as market breadth continues to widen and more stocks participate in the market rally, he says.\n\n\"You have a lot of leading active providers coming into the space. The market has been dominated by top names like the Mag Seven that have been really driving performance, and you are seeing market breadth widen out. That provides other opportunities, particularly in the active space,\" he said.\n\nMaier says that within the massive opportunity for active funds in the coming year, he sees particularly ripe potential within fixed income.\n\nHe says that with just 9,000 securities in the global equity market, versus around 3 million unique bonds in the fixed income market, it becomes very difficult for an individual or team of financial advisors to effectively manage on their own within fixed income.\n\nActive funds can fill that gap, since they can effectively navigate factors like interest rate sensitivity, credit risk, and liquidity, unlike passive fixed income strategies, he said.\n\nThat's especially true as interest rates remain high, he added.\n\n\"We think that with active management, there's just so much opportunity there, particularly where we are with the rate cycle,\" he said. \"Rates are still relatively high, so locking in higher yields, I think, makes a lot of sense. And having someone help you do it also makes a lot of sense, so I think you'll see a good amount of growth there.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

    "text": "If a good chunk of your net worth is tied up in real estate, it can be tricky to access money in a pinch. If you need cash, a home equity loan can give you access to money so you don’t have to resort to expensive credit card debt or personal loans.\n\nAnother perk of home equity loans is the potential to write off the interest paid to lower your tax bill. That said, you must meet a few rules and requirements to be eligible for this tax deduction.\n\nDig deeper: What is a home equity loan? A complete overview\n\nIn this article:\n\nIs home equity loan interest tax deductible?\n\nRules for the home equity loan interest tax deduction\n\nHow to claim your tax deduction\n\nFAQs\n\nSo can you deduct the interest paid on your home equity loan (HEL) when you file your taxes? It depends on how you use the money. According to the IRS, home equity loan interest can be tax deductible as long as you use the funds to \"buy, build, or substantially improve” your home. However, you won't qualify for a tax deduction if you use the loan funds for other purposes, like paying off your student loans or medical debt.\n\nEligibility doesn’t just hinge on how taxpayers use the funds — it also depends on when you took out the loan and the total amount of your home debt. Keep reading for more information on the rules for deducting interest on home equity loans.\n\nLearn more: Tax deduction vs. tax credit — What’s the difference?\n\nThe rules for home equity loan interest tax deductions changed after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) took effect in late 2017. Here are the current rules under this act.\n\nFor HELs taken out after Dec. 15, 2017: You’re allowed to deduct interest paid on up to $750,000 of home loans. If you’re married and filing separately, the limit goes down to $375,000. Remember that this cap applies to the total of all residential debt, including your first mortgage, home equity loans, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). Again, you can only deduct the interest on your HEL or HELOC if you used the money to “buy, build, or substantially improve” the property.\n\nFor HELs taken out on or before Dec. 15, 2017: You can claim tax deductions on interest paid on up to $1 million of qualified residential debt, regardless of how you use the funds. If you’re married and filing separately, the limit is $500,000.\n\nNote that your home equity loan, whether issued before or after TCJA took effect, must be secured by your first or second home to be eligible for interest tax deductions.\n\nRead more: Are home improvements tax deductible?\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act can impact your tax deduction if you take out mortgage debt after Dec. 15, 2017.\n\nLet’s say you bought a house in 2021 and currently have a mortgage balance of $720,000. Then, you took out a $75,000 home equity loan in 2023 to make significant home improvements. Since your combined total mortgage balance ($795,000) exceeds the $750,000 limit set by the TCJA, you can’t claim all interest paid on your home loans. However, you may deduct interest paid on the first $750,000.\n\nIt’s important to note that these rules set by the TCJA will expire on Dec. 31, 2025. In other words, if Congress does not pass new legislation, the interest deduction limits may revert to pre-TCJA levels in 2026.\n\nDig deeper: Mortgage interest tax deduction — How it works and when it makes sense\n\nHere’s how to claim your home equity loan interest tax deduction and lower your tax bill to Uncle Sam.\n\nNot every homeowner with a home equity loan is eligible to write off the interest they paid on it. The total amount of your mortgage debt, when you took out the home equity loan, and what you use the funds for can all affect your eligibility. To avoid any issues when tax season comes, review the TCJA rules above to see if your loan qualifies for a deduction. Contact a tax professional if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nYou must itemize your deductions to qualify for a home equity loan interest tax deduction instead of opting for the standardized tax deduction.\n\nThe standard deduction for the 2024 tax year (filed in 2025) is:\n\nSingle filers and married couples filing separately: $14,600\n\nHeads of household: $21,900\n\nMarried couples filing jointly: $29,200\n\nItemizing doesn’t always make financial sense, especially if the total of your itemized deductions is lower than the standard deduction for your filing status. However, if your itemized deductions are well above your standard deduction amount, it could be worth your time to claim home equity loan interest tax deductions.\n\nRead more: How to decide between a standard and itemized tax deduction\n\nBefore filing an itemized return to claim the home equity loan interest tax deduction, make sure you have these documents handy:\n\nIRS Form 1098: This form details the mortgage interest you’ve paid during the tax year. You should receive this form from your lender before the tax season if you paid mortgage interest of $600 or more.\n\nIRS Form 1040: You’ll use this form to itemize your deductions. By submitting this document to the IRS, you're foregoing the standard deduction.\n\nRelevant receipts or bank statements: Have your receipts and bank statements handy to show how you used the funds from the home equity loan. You must use the money to build, buy, or make significant upgrades to your home to qualify for the deduction.\n\nLearn more: A list of tax deductions for homeowners\n\nTo report a home equity loan on your taxes, you need IRS Form 1098 (Mortgage Interest Statement), which you’ll receive from your lender before it’s time to file your taxes. The form shows the interest you paid on your primary mortgage loan, home equity loan, home equity line of credit, and any other residential debt in the previous year. You’ll then itemize your deductions using IRS Form 1040.\n\nA home equity loan can lower your tax bill since the interest you paid on it may be tax deductible. For home equity loans taken out after Dec. 15, 2017, and before 2026, the IRS lets you write off interest paid on up to $750,000 of qualified loans, or $375,000 if you’re married and filing separately — but there are rules about how you spend the funds. For qualified loans taken out on or before Dec. 15, 2017, you can deduct interest paid on a combined qualified mortgage debt balance of $1 million, or $500,000 if you’re married and filing separately.\n\nYes, the interest paid on your second mortgage may qualify for a tax deduction. Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit are two types of second mortgages. If you itemize your tax deductions, you can write off second mortgage interest as long as you use the funds to build or buy a house or to make major home improvements.\n\nThis article was edited by Laura Grace Tarpley.\n\nHome equity loan requirements include a good credit score, sufficient equity in your home, and more. Learn whether you qualify for a home equity loan.\n\nThe best home equity loan lenders offer perks such as low fees, no appraisals, and high borrowing limits. Find out which lender is best for a home equity loan.\n\nHome equity loan closing costs are typically 2% to 5% of your loan amount, though there are ways to pay less up-front. Learn what to expect when closing on a HEL.\n\nThe amount you can borrow with a home equity loan depends on your home value, LTV ratio, CLTV ratio, and more. Learn how to calculate how much you can take out.\n\nHome equity loans are great options for homeowners who have built equity and need a lump of cash. Learn how to qualify and apply for a home equity loan.\n\nA second mortgage lets you borrow from your home equity, and you’ll take on an additional monthly mortgage payment.

    "timestamp": "2025-01-04 18:06:47",
    "text": "SmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nThe fact that Americans are living longer has made the usual approach to financial planning incomplete, according to a new study of approximately 1,200 people and 10 focus groups by MIT AgeLab and Transamerica. The traditional three-part plan of education, work and retirement and aiming to ensure that people have enough to live comfortably in retirement, fails to take into account the growing longevity of Americans, it concludes. Instead, the researchers behind the report advocate focusing on three factors: well-being, work and finances as the three major phases of adulthood.\n\nDo you have questions about long-term planning for retirement? Speak with a financial advisor today.\n\nAmericans are living much longer than their grandparents and great-grandparents, with the average life expectancy growing from 68 years in 1950 to nearly 79 years by 2009. With these longer lifespans come longer retirements. While a man retiring in 1970 lived less than 13 years in retirement, the average length of retirement for men in 2020 was nearly 19 years. Someone who’s 65 in 2023 has about a 50% likelihood of living two more decades.\n\nThis trend is expected to continue. While there were approximately 92,000 octogenarians in America as of 2020, that figure is expected to nearly triple in less than 25 years, for an estimated total of 270,000 Americans older than 100 by 2045. In other words, if they stop working at age 67, they could spend as much as 33 years in retirement.\n\nTo get a feeling for just how long 33 years can be, consider that in 1990 George H. W. Bush was president, Madonna was at the top of the music charts and the No. 1 TV show was “Cheers.”\n\n“While Americans are generally optimistic about their future, they may not fully appreciate how much their financial needs, priorities, and life circumstances will change over time,” said Dr. Joseph Coughlin, director of MIT AgeLab. “More than ever, planning for longevity means understanding what matters most at each stage of adulthood, finding balance, and supporting priorities with the behaviors and actions that lead to a better future.”\n\nPhil Eckman, president of Workplace Solutions at Transamerica, said that “the way we approach our lives and the way we work is changing. People want flexibility and choice in all parts of their life, both at work and home.”\n\nTraditional financial planning was built around what, by today’s standards, was a comparatively short retirement. That meant leisure was the focus, building a nest egg adequate to fund what now looks like a comparatively short retirement. But now that the length of retirement has grown substantially, this phase of life is dynamic rather than solely centered around leisure.\n\n“Older adulthood is when clients may begin to celebrate the goals they were saving toward, such as dream vacations or having more time to spend with family, but still a time when many should be prepared to live for several more decades,” the report concluded.\n\nThat means retirees can use financial advisors as coaches to understand the complexity of this phase of life. They may also be able to help them understand the various ways they can “prioritize social, emotional and physical well-being relative to financial or work-related goals in the upcoming 10 years of their lives,” according to the report.\n\nIf you'd like to speak to a fiduciary financial advisor, you can get matched with this free tool.\n\nMidlife adults face complex and emotional challenges, from striving to advance in their careers to caring for children and parents. With such an array of challenges, it’s not surprising that this cohort reported the lowest exercise rates and said they ate healthy less often than any other age group. One implication is that people in this group should work with their financial advisors to arrange priorities to ensure that they are taking care of themselves, both financially and in other ways.\n\n“Financial professionals can serve as agenda setters for clients in midlife, helping them to anticipate future needs, challenges, and celebrations,” the report stated. “For example, financial professionals can both support clients who are in a present-day caregiving role, while helping them anticipate a time in later life when they may require care themselves.”\n\nThe study also found that this cohort tends to be motivated to invest in their well-being, establish themselves in their careers in the short- and long-term and begin saving for key financial milestones.\n\nYounger adults can benefit by using the advice of financial advisors to adopt new habits, routines and attitudes that will prepare them both for the near and distant future. They also should work with financial advisors to create an adequate emergency fund and build their net worth.\n\nRetirement isn’t just about money. Longer lifespans mean that retirement will be far more dynamic than the leisure focus our parents and grandparents had. Increasingly, it’s more about overall well-being. That’s something that includes having an adequate nest egg, but it’s increasingly about relationships, personal goals, health and avocational opportunities. The report finds that getting financial advice in each phase of adulthood is key to having a retirement characterized by well-being.\n\nOne way to get help planning for retirement is to work with a financial advisor who can help you answer all your questions about retirement options, including Social Security and Medicare. Finding a financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have free introductory calls with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you.  If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nAre you a financial advisor looking to grow your business?

    "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) took the world, and the stock market, by storm in early 2023 and has not slowed since. Investors have flocked to the companies developing and producing the chips to power AI models, the cloud companies building massive AI data centers, and even the software companies deploying AI applications.\n\nHowever, the energy required to power all this innovation could become an increasingly hot topic in the coming years. According to estimates by Wells Fargo, AI technology's electricity consumption could increase from 8 terawatt-hours in 2024 to 652 terawatt-hours by 2030. Nuclear power could help solve this challenge. Emissions could discourage fossil fuel use, and renewable energy remains too intermittent to depend on alone. That opens the door for nuclear power, which is efficient and clean.\n\nAI's long-term energy needs could help fuel growth in companies exposed to nuclear energy, so consider buying these three top nuclear stocks in January.\n\nUranium is the fuel used for nuclear fission, and Cameco (NYSE: CCJ) is one of the leading uranium producers. The Canadian company accounts for approximately 18% of the global uranium supply and has controlling interests in uranium mines in Canada, the United States, and Kazakhstan. The company is poised for long-term growth as big technology companies and entire countries consider nuclear power as a way to meet energy needs while reducing carbon emissions. For example, Meta Platforms recently announced plans to source nuclear energy to power its AI data centers, starting in the early 2030s.\n\nIt's becoming apparent that nuclear energy is gaining momentum. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, 63 nuclear reactors are currently under construction, and demand for nuclear could grow by as much as 2.5 times its current capacity by 2050. In addition, geopolitical tensions, including the U.S. ban on uranium imports from Russia, could further boost business for Western producers like Cameco.\n\nCameco's business has picked up over the past couple of years. Analysts estimate that the company's revenue will hit $2.3 billion in 2025. Assuming governments and corporations continue supporting nuclear energy, this could be the early stages of a very long growth story.\n\nThose who don't want a pure nuclear investment could consider Southern Company (NYSE: SO), one of the largest energy companies in the United States. Its core businesses include electricity generation and electric and natural gas utilities that serve more than 9 million customers. Utility businesses produce dependable revenue streams because society's energy needs never stop. Southern Company's energy production also spans several sources, including gas, coal, nuclear, and renewables.\n\nSouthern Company has invested heavily in nuclear energy. It operates eight total power units across three plants, and its newest units were the first newly constructed in the U.S. for commercial operations in three decades. Earlier this year, Microsoft and Constellation Energy inked a 20-year deal to restart a nuclear power unit at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Station in Pennsylvania to power its data centers. This potential game-changer for the industry opens the door for Southern Company, located near Virginia, the country's data center capital, to do something similar.\n\nIn the meantime, the stock offers a 3.5% dividend yield, compensating shareholders for holding the stock. It's not the cheapest utility, at 20 times earnings, but it isn't unbearable for long-term investors, especially if AI tailwinds rev up Southern Company's long-term growth.\n\nLongtime conglomerate General Electric split into pieces, and its energy business, GE Vernova (NYSE: GEV), now stands on its own. GE Vernova is a diversified clean energy technology company that deals in clean power generation, grid electrification, and wind and gas turbines. Its power generation business includes nuclear, providing reactors, fuel, services, and steam turbines for electricity generation.\n\nSociety is slowly and steadily transitioning from fossil fuels to cleaner energy alternatives. Such a shift will take many years, potentially positioning GE Vernova for a multidecade growth opportunity. Management currently anticipates high single-digit revenue growth through 2028. GE Vernova is also investing $5 billion cumulatively through 2028 in research and development to drive long-term growth.\n\nThe stock isn't cheap, at a forward P/E ratio of 124. However, analysts estimate the company will grow earnings by an average of 46% annually over the next couple of years, so strong earnings growth comes with that price tag. Investors unsure about buying in here can nibble for now and buy more aggressively if the stock pulls back. That said, it's hard not to like the stock's long-term potential amid soaring electricity demand and a clean energy transition.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cameco, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Cameco wasn’t one of them.

They suggest that while FDIC examiners have been cautious towards the crypto sector, which has been beset by scams, bankruptcies and volatility, they did not order banks to entirely cut off the crypto sector.\n\nThe documents are being released weeks before President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration is expected to outline a broad crypto policy overhaul. Trump is expected to issue an executive order directing bank regulators to go easier on the sector, potentially as early as his Jan. 20 inauguration.\n\nSeveral of the FDIC letters show staff directed banks to either pause entering crypto initiatives or refrain from further expanding client crypto services. In others, the FDIC required banks to answer detailed questions before proceeding further with crypto ventures.\n\nThe internal memo, meanwhile, distinguishes between a bank engaging directly in crypto activities, like holding crypto assets in custody, and offering traditional banking services for crypto clients, like lending and providing deposit accounts. The first category requires stricter scrutiny, it says.\n\nThe memo echoes comments made in December by FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg, who told reporters the agency does not \"debank\" crypto firms in terms of access to bank accounts, but direct crypto engagement by banks is a \"subject of supervisory attention.\"\n\n\"Crypto-related activities may pose significant safety and soundness and consumer protection risks, as well as financial stability concerns,\" the memo notes, adding such risks are still \"evolving.\"\n\n(Reporting by Pete Schroeder and Douglas Gillison; editing by Michelle Price, Chizu Nomiyama and David Gregorio)",

    "text": "The idea of investing can be intimidating if you’re just starting out, but it’s an important part of saving for various financial goals and building wealth. You’ll encounter many different market environments throughout your investing life, so don’t get too caught up in whether now is the perfect time to get started.\n\nBut before making any investment, it’s important for new investors to know what their tolerance is for risk. Certain investments carry more risk than others and you don’t want to be surprised after you’ve made the investment. Think about how long you can do without the money you’ll be investing and whether you’re comfortable not accessing it for a few years or longer.\n\nHere are some top investment ideas for those just starting out.\n\nNeed expert guidance when it comes to managing your investments or planning for retirement?\n\nBankrate’s AdvisorMatch can connect you to a CFP® professional to help you achieve your financial goals.\n\nThis can be one of the simplest ways to boost the return on your money above what you’re earning in a typical checking account. High-yield savings accounts, which are often opened through an online bank, tend to pay higher interest on average than standard savings accounts while still giving customers regular access to their money.\n\nAnd with online banks offering some of the highest rates in years on high-yield savings accounts, they can be a great place to park money you’re saving for a purchase in the next couple years or just holding in case of an emergency.\n\nCDs are another way to earn additional interest on your savings, but they will tie up your money for longer than a high-yield savings account. You can purchase a CD for different time periods such as six months, one year or even five years, but you typically can’t access the money before the CD matures without paying a penalty.\n\nThese are considered extremely safe and if you purchase one through a federally insured bank, you’re covered up to $250,000 per depositor, per ownership category.\n\nThis can be one of the simplest ways to get started in investing and comes with some major incentives that could benefit you now and in the future. Most employers offer to match a portion of what you agree to save for retirement out of your regular paycheck. If your employer offers a match and you don’t participate in the plan, you are turning down free money.\n\nIn a traditional 401(k), the contributions are made prior to being taxed and grow tax-free until retirement age. Some employers offer Roth 401(k)s, which allow contributions to be made after taxes. If you select this option, you won’t pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.\n\nThese workplace retirement plans are great savings tools because they’re automatic once you’ve made your initial selections, allow you to consistently invest over time and have higher contribution limits. Often, you can even choose to invest in target-date mutual funds, which manage their portfolios based on a specific retirement date. As you get closer to the target date, the fund’s allocation will shift away from riskier assets to account for a shorter investment horizon.\n\nMutual funds give investors the opportunity to invest in a basket of stocks or bonds (or other assets) that they might not be able to easily build on their own.\n\nThe most popular mutual funds track indexes such as the S&P 500, which is comprised of around 500 of the largest companies in the U.S. Index funds usually come with very low fees for the funds’ investors, and occasionally no fee at all. These low costs help investors keep more of the funds’ returns for themselves and can be a great way to build wealth over time.\n\nExchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are similar to mutual funds in that they hold a basket of securities, but they trade throughout the day in the same way a stock would. ETFs do not come with the same minimum investment requirements as mutual funds, which typically come in at a few thousand dollars. ETFs can be purchased for the cost of one share plus any fees or commissions associated with the purchase, though you can get started with even less if your broker allows fractional share investing.\n\nBoth ETFs and mutual funds are ideal assets to hold in tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs.\n\nBuying stocks in individual companies is the riskiest investment option discussed here, but it can also be one of the most rewarding. But before you start making trades, you should consider whether buying a stock makes sense for you. Ask yourself if you are investing for the long-term, which generally means at least five years, and whether you understand the business you are investing in. Stocks are priced every second of the trading day and because of that, people often get drawn into the short-term trading mentality when they own individual stocks.\n\nBut a stock is a partial ownership stake in a real business and over time your fortune will rise with that of the underlying company you invested in. If you don’t feel you have the expertise or stomach to ride it out with individual stocks, consider taking the more diversified approach offered by mutual funds or ETFs instead.\n\nInvesting is crucial if you want to maintain the purchasing power of your savings and reach long-term financial goals like retirement or building wealth. If you let your savings sit in a traditional bank account earning little or no interest, eventually inflation will decrease the value of your hard-earned cash. By investing in assets like stocks and bonds, you can make sure your savings keeps up with inflation or even outpaces it.\n\nShort-term investments like high-yield savings accounts or money market mutual funds can help you earn more on your savings while you work towards a big purchase such as a car or a down payment on a house. Stocks and ETFs are considered better for long-term goals like retirement because they are more likely to earn better returns over time, but they carry additional risk.\n\nRisk tolerance: Before you start investing, you’ll want to understand your own tolerance for risk. Volatile investments such as stocks can make some people very uncomfortable when they decline, which can cause you to sell at the worst possible time. Knowing your risk tolerance will help you choose which investments are best suited for you.\n\nFinancial goals: Establish both short- and long-term goals that you want to achieve through saving and investing. Understanding your investment goals will help you develop a solid plan.\n\nActive or passive: You’ll also need to decide if you’d like to be a passive investor or an active one. A passive investor typically owns an asset like diversified mutual funds or ETFs that charge low fees, while an active investor might choose individual investments or mutual funds that aim to outperform the market. Studies have shown that passive investing tends to outperform active investing over time.\n\nDo-it-yourself or hire someone: You can also choose to manage your own investments through an online broker, or hire a financial advisor (or robo-advisor) to help you out. You’ll likely incur lower costs if you do it yourself, but an advisor can be helpful for those just starting out.\n\nTaxes: If you own investments in an individual or joint account, you’ll likely need to pay taxes on the interest, dividends and capital gains you earn. You can avoid these taxes by owning investments in tax-advantaged retirement accounts such as an IRA.\n\nThe good news is that you don’t need much money to start investing. Most online brokers have no account minimums to get started and some offer fractional share investing for those starting with small dollar amounts. For just a few dollars you can purchase ETFs that allow you to build a diversified portfolio of stocks. Micro-investing platforms will even let you round up purchases made through a debit card as a way to get started with investing.\n\nIf you’re just starting out in the investment world, make sure to consider your risk tolerance and what your financial goals are before committing money to an investment. Some investments, like high-yield savings accounts, allow for quick access to money if emergencies come up. Meanwhile, stocks should probably be part of a long-term investment plan instead.\n\nMany beginning investors also turn to robo-advisors, where an algorithm automatically selects and manages a diversified portfolio of exchange-traded funds for you, based around your individual financial needs and appetite for risk.\n\nEditorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision. In addition, investors are advised that past investment product performance is no guarantee of future price appreciation.",

    "text": "By Lewis Krauskopf\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -The stock market faces its first major test of the year in the coming week, with investors counting on the U.S. jobs report to show a stable but not overheated economy that underpins expectations for equity gains in 2025.\n\nStocks wobbled at the end of December and the start of January, cooling off after a torrid run. The benchmark S&P 500 closed 2024 with a 23% rise and posted its biggest two-year gain since 1997-1998.\n\nProspects for a third straight standout year hinge in part on the strength of the economy, with labor market data among the most important reads into the economy's health. The data could also help clarify the Federal Reserve's interest rate plans after the central bank last month rattled markets by reducing its projected rate cuts for 2025.\n\n\"Investors are going to want to see confirmation that labor trends remain solid, which means the economic outlook probably remains firm,\" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.\n\n\"Any kind of data that suggests things are weakening a little bit more than expected I think could create volatility,\" Saglimbene said.\n\nInvestors enter the year generally upbeat about the U.S. economy. A Natixis Investment Managers survey conducted at the end of last year found 73% of institutional investors said the U.S. will avoid a recession in 2025.\n\nLabor market data has been volatile in recent months following aerospace industry strikes and hurricanes. November data showed growth of 227,000 jobs that rebounded from a tepid rise in October.\n\nThe three-month average gain of 138,000 \"suggests that hiring continues to slow gradually,\" Capital Economics analysts said in a note.\n\nThe report for December, due out on Jan 10, is expected to show growth of 150,000 jobs with the unemployment rate at 4.2%, according to a Reuters poll of economists.\n\nFollowing the prior two reports, \"this is going to be probably the first clean read of what is the underlying trend in the labor market,\" said Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones.\n\nInvestors are also wary of the jobs report revealing an overly strong economy, with a revival of inflation seen as one of the key risks to markets early in the year.\n\nThe Fed at its December meeting lifted its forecast for expected inflation in 2025, paving the way for higher interest rates than it previously forecast.\n\nAfter lowering its benchmark rate at three straight meetings, the Fed is expected to pause its easing cycle when it next meets at the end of January before making further cuts of about 50 basis points over the rest of the year.\n\nFor the jobs report, the market is \"looking for that Goldilocks number -- neither too hot, nor too cold,\" Kourkafas said.\n\nOTHER EMPLOYMENT DATA\n\nWhile the payrolls data will be the most closely followed release, the coming week brings other market-sensitive employment figures, as well as reports on factory orders and the services sector.\n\nDespite a strong 2024, stocks were weak in December, with the S&P 500 falling 2.5%. December had only five days with more stocks in the index gaining as opposed to declining, the lowest share of such relatively positive days for any month going back to 1990, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nFollowing the end-of-year holiday period, \"next week probably ushers in more robust volumes, which would certainly be a better indication of directionality for the market,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth.\n\n\"A solid jobs report would certainly help turn things around in this market that has otherwise been pretty soft to end the year and start the new year,\" Hogan said.\n\nWall St Week Ahead runs every Friday.

    "text": "Uber (UBER) shares have had a rough ride in 2024, lagging behind the broader market with only a 12% gain over the last 12 months. However, my bullish outlook remains intact, considering that recent underperformance doesn’t reflect any weakness in the company’s business fundamentals. The company has been posting solid revenue and profit growth while generating impressive cash flow. The main factor weighing on investor sentiment seems to be the fear that robotaxis could disrupt the ride-sharing industry in the coming years.\n\nDiscover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener\n\nWhile this is a valid concern, it arguably remains a distant risk. Uber has the capacity to adapt to emerging technologies, backed by its flexibility to make new investments, diversify its business, and maintain a financially viable ecosystem within the broader mobility industry.\n\nIn this article, I’ll share a few reasons why I believe Uber stock is worth considering as a Buy in 2025 and why the market seems to be overlooking them.\n\nTo start, one of the first reasons behind my bullishness on Uber lies in the value proposition of its ride-sharing and food delivery business. A look at Uber’s top-line evolution over the last few years shows that the company’s revenue was nearly $42 billion during the past twelve months, while in 2019, that figure was $13 billion.\n\nHaving quadrupled its revenues over the last five years, I wouldn’t be surprised if this growth trend continues, albeit not as robustly, but with a certain intensity. More and more individuals have realized the convenience of both ride-sharing and food delivery. One possible cause for this trend may also be connected to the increasing costs of owning a car in many parts of the world, favoring the use of ride-sharing, especially in large cities.\n\nAs a result, analysts estimate that Uber’s top line could grow by 17.3% in 2024, followed by 15.7% and 15.6% growth in 2025 and 2026, respectively. Moreover, with Uber set to report its second consecutive full year of profitability, projections suggest that its EPS CAGR over the next three to five years will be an impressive 41.2%. Therefore, considering that Uber is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 22.5x, if the long-term CAGR estimates prove accurate or close to it, Uber’s PEG ratio stands at 0.55, which appears very cheap.\n\nAnother piece of evidence that connects with my favorable outlook for Uber stock is that the company has been able to expand profit margins nicely in recent years as it has benefited from economies of scale. At the moment, operating margins of 6.4% are significantly higher than the negative 75% seen in 2020.\n\nMuch of this reversal in operating margins over the past few years correlates with Uber’s asset-light business model, where drivers use their own cars (which end up being Uber’s assets). Thus, the company is able to scale its operations without a proportional increase in capital expenditure. This approach allowed Uber to generate $1.7 billion in free cash flow in Q3 2024, up 133% from the same period last year.\n\nAlthough the company’s balance sheet is not impeccable–the company holds $10.9 billion in long-term debt–it does hold about $9 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments. This gives the company plenty of capital to fund growth initiatives. It also means that cash and investments will likely not be a bottleneck for Uber, and the company can use some of its growing cash flow to gradually pay down long-term debt, reduce interest expenses, and boost profitability.\n\nThe third point where I see Uber as a great Buy opportunity throughout 2025 correlates with the bearish momentum around its stock, shadowed by Tesla’s (TSLA) robotaxi fears, where I see a certain tone of exaggeration. As shown in the graph below, throughout 2024—particularly in the last quarter—there was a lot of hype around Tesla’s stock announcement, especially with its upcoming robotaxi project set for 2025. This created a lot of negative sentiment towards Uber’s business model.\n\nIn theory, fears are not unreasonable. Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk has said over the past year that the model for Robotaxi service would be a mix between Airbnb (ABNB) and Uber, where Tesla would own and operate a fleet of cars and sell to private individuals who want to own their own robotaxis. However, according to Wedbush four-star analyst Dan Ives, the reality of Robotaxi’s implementation is still a long way off. According to the analyst’s comments from earlier this year, “Our view is while this is an exciting announcement around robotaxis we do not expect full autonomy (no steering wheel models) until 2030.”\n\nAnother point in Uber’s favor is how much its business has diversified beyond just ride-sharing. The company has built a highly profitable ecosystem where food delivery, logistics, and transportation play key roles. In Q3, delivery alone accounted for 30% of Uber’s revenue, while freight made up 11%. Uber’s management team seems well-prepared to adapt to disruptive changes in the ride-sharing industry. Indeed, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi believes that Tesla’s robotaxi project will rely on resources Uber already has in order to be financially viable.\n\nLooking at what Wall Street analysts are saying about Uber stock, the mood is pretty optimistic. Out of 35 experts, 33 are all in favor of buying, while just two are sitting on the fence. In addition, the average price target of $93.35 suggests that the stock is significantly undervalued, pointing to an impressive upside potential of 44.5% from its current price.\n\nSee more UBER analyst ratings\n\nAs highlighted throughout the article, there are numerous reasons to be bullish on Uber heading into 2025. The company’s fundamentals are the strongest they have ever been, growth is accelerating, and the outlook for the future is exceptionally bright. I see the stock as a prime example of “growth at a reasonable price,” especially since concerns over the Robotaxi project appear wildly overstated and are already baked into the stock’s valuation.\n\nFor these reasons, I’m maintaining my confident Buy rating on UBER.\n\nDisclosure",

    "text": "(Reuters) - Two Federal Reserve policymakers on Saturday said they feel the U.S. central bank's job of taming inflation is not yet done, but also signaled they do not want to risk damaging the labor market as they try to finish that job.\n\nThe remarks, from Governor Adriana Kugler and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, highlight the delicate balancing act facing U.S. central bankers this year as they look to slow their pace of rate-cutting. The Fed lowered short-term rates by a full percentage point last year, to a current range of 4.25%-4.50%.\n\nInflation by the Fed's preferred measure is well down from its mid-2022 peak of around 7%, registering 2.4% in November. Still that's above the Fed's 2% goal, and in December policymakers projected slower progress toward that goal than they had earlier anticipated.\n\n\"We are fully aware that we are not there yet - no one is popping champagne anywhere,\" Kugler said at the annual American Economic Association conference in San Francisco. \"And at the same time ... we want the unemployment rate to stay where it is\" and not increase rapidly.\n\nIn November, unemployment was 4.2%, consistent in both her and colleague Daly's view with maximum employment, the Fed's second goal alongside its price stability goal.\n\n\"At this point, I would not want to see further slowing in the labor market — maybe gradually moving around in bumps and chunks on a given month, but certainly not additional slowing in the labor market,\" said Daly, who was speaking on the same panel.\n\nThe policymakers were not asked, nor did they volunteer their views, about the potential impact of incoming President Donald Trump's economic policies, including tariffs and tax cuts, which some have speculated could fuel growth and reignite inflation.\n\n(Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Sandra Maler and Franklin Paul)",

    "timestamp": "2025-01-04 23:33:15",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — By blocking a Japanese company’s takeover of U.S. Steel, President Joe Biden said he was protecting good jobs in the American heartland. He may be putting them at risk instead.\n\nIn making its nearly $15 billion bid for the storied Pittsburgh-based steelmaker, Nippon Steel had promised to invest $2.7 billion in U.S. Steel’s aging blast furnace operations in Gary, Indiana, and Pennsylvania’s Mon Valley. It also vowed not to reduce production capacity in the United States over the next decade without first getting U.S. government approval.\n\n“They were going to invest in the Valley,’’ said Jason Zugai, an operating technician and vice president of the United Steelworkers union local at a U.S. Steel plant in the Mon Valley. “They committed to 10 years of no layoffs. We won’t have those commitments from anybody.’’\n\nZugai and some other Mon Valley steelworkers supported the Nippon deal in defiance of the union’s national leadership, which pressured the Biden administration to kill it.\n\nLosing the Nippon-U.S. Steel deal “will be a disaster for Pennsylvania,’’ said Gordon Johnson, who follows U.S. Steel stock on Wall Street as founder of GLJ Research. “I really don’t understand. This is not in the interest of the workers. It’s not in the interest of the shareholders of U.S. Steel.’’\n\nOn Friday, Biden said he was stopping the Nippon takeover — after federal regulators deadlocked on whether to approve it — because “a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority. ... Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure.’’\n\nU.S. Steel stock dropped 6.5% on the news Friday.\n\nThe decision, announced less than three weeks before the president leaves the White House, reflects a growing bipartisan shift away from free trade and open investment.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump had already come out against the Nippon takeover. “As President,” he wrote last month on his Truth Social platform, “I will block this deal from happening. Buyer Beware!!!”\n\nIn a joint statement, Nippon and U.S. Steel called Biden’s decision “a clear violation of due process and the law’’ and suggested they would sue to salvage their deal: “We are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights.’’\n\nU.S. Steel was founded in 1901 in a merger that involved American business titans J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie and instantly created the largest company in the world. As the U.S. grew to world dominance in the 20th century, U.S. Steel grew with it. In 1943, at the height of the World War II manufacturing boom, U.S. Steel employed 340,000 people.\n\nBut foreign competition — from Japan in the 1970s and ‘80s and later from China — gradually eroded U.S. Steel’s position and forced it to close plants and lay off workers. The company now employs fewer than 22,000 in an industry dominated by the Chinese.\n\nThe U.S. government has sought over the years to protect U.S. Steel and other American steelmakers by imposing taxes on imported steel. During his first term, Trump slapped 25% tariffs on foreign steel, and Biden kept them or converted them into import quotas. Either way, the trade barriers kept the price of American steel artificially high, giving U.S. Steel and others a financial boost.\n\nU.S. Steel is profitable and is sitting on $1.8 billion in cash, though that is down from $2.9 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nUnited Steelworkers President David McCall declared Friday that U.S. Steel had the financial resources to go it alone. “It can easily remain a strong and resilient company,’’ he told reporters.\n\nBut U.S. Steel has said it needs the cash from Nippon Steel to keep investing in blast furnaces like the ones in Pennsylvania and Indiana.\n\n“Without the Nippon Steel transaction, U. S. Steel will largely pivot away from its blast furnace facilities, putting thousands of good-paying union jobs at risk, negatively impacting numerous communities across the locations where its facilities exist,’’ U.S. Steel warned in September. The company also threatened to move its headquarters out of Pittsburgh.\n\nOn its own, U.S. Steel seems poised to focus on newer electric arc furnaces, such as its Big River plant in Arkansas, which can make high-quality steel products more efficiently and at lower prices compared to blast furnaces, said Josh Spoores, the Pennsylvania-based head of steel Americas analysis for commodity researcher CRU.\n\n“I don’t know if they don’t have the will, but they seem to have seen that it’s a much better investment, a much better rate of return if they look to invest in an electric arc furnace rather than a blast furnace,” Spoores said. He noted that no steelmaker has built a blast furnace in North America for decades.\n\nOne possibility is that another company will step in and make a bid for U.S. Steel.\n\nIn 2023, arch-rival Cleveland-Cliffs offered to buy U.S. Steel for $7 billion. U.S. Steel turned the offer down and ended up accepting the nearly $15 billion all-cash offer from Nippon Steel, which is the deal that Biden nixed Friday. Perhaps, analysts say, Cleveland-Cliffs will try again.\n\nIn a statement, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro warned U.S. Steel management against “threatening the jobs and livelihoods of the Pennsylvanians who work at the Mon Valley Works and at U.S. Steel HQ and their families.’’\n\nShapiro also said companies that put in bids to buy U.S. Steel in the future must make the same commitments to “capital investment and protecting and growing Pennsylvania jobs that Nippon Steel placed on the table.’’\n\n___\n\nMarc Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",

    "text": "GM (GM) reported strong fourth quarter and full-year 2024 sales results in the US, capping off a robust year for the Big Three automaker. GM’s results come as crosstown rival Ford also saw sales gains in Q4 and for the year.\n\nGM reported Q4 sales jumped 21% from a year ago and were up 4% in 2024 to 2.7 million vehicles, with full-size pickup sales up for the fifth straight year, hitting their highest level since 2007. Sales of full-size SUVs like the Tahoe, Suburban, and Yukon also propelled GM to a category win in the segment for the 50th straight year.\n\nBoth GM and rival Ford had their best sales years since 2019 as the industry climbed back to pre-pandemic sales levels.\n\nGM shares were up slightly in midday trade.\n\nIt was also a big quarter for EVs, which GM continues to see as the future despite slowing sales growth across the industry. EV sales jumped 50% for the quarter and 125% for the year, GM said.\n\nGM also noted it doubled its EV market share over the course of the year, eating away mainly at Tesla. EVs like the Cadillac Lyriq (up 111.6%), Blazer EV (up over 1000%), and Silverado EV (up 391%) were behind the EV push.\n\n“It was a great year for us across our product lines,” said Rory Harvey, GM executive vice president and president of global markets, in a statement. “We have something for everyone, no matter what they like to drive.\"\n\nGM’s luxury brand Cadillac saw sales jump 35% in Q4 and nearly 9% for the year, with the aforementioned Lyriq EV and XT6 SUV powering the gains.\n\nLooking under the hood, GM's overall business and its inventory situation are doing well compared to the industry. For the quarter, GM said average transaction prices (ATPs) rose each month (to $51,292) and incentives declined; GM ended the year with an incentive spend per vehicle of 4.2% of ATP in Q4, whereas the industry stood at 7.1%.\n\nThe company also ended the year with 54 days of inventory supply. Usually around 60 days of supply is a good mark for a large automaker, indicating a good selection of product for consumers but not a supply glut at dealers. For comparison's sake, earlier this year Stellantis (STLA) was struggling with inventory levels hitting 100 days, leading to deep discounting.\n\nIt was not all good news for GM's Q4, as the company wound down its autonomous Cruise business and took a big $5 billion writedown in its China business.\n\nAt the moment, however, its home US market is its largest and most profitable. GM will give investors more on that when it reports Q4 and 2024 full-year results on Tuesday, Jan. 28, before the opening bell.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

    "text": "The first month of a new year can signal market performance for the rest of the year, prompting investors to behave like \"hyperactive first-graders playing musical chairs,\" Sam Stovall, CFRA Research chief investment strategist, told CNBC.\n\nWall Street is keenly focused on January's initial trading sessions as the first month of a new year can signal market performance for the rest of the year.\n\nThat's after the Santa Claus rally largely failed to materialize, while 2025 started with a selloff followed by a rebound on Friday.\n\n\"I think what you just said indicates that investors are no better than hyperactive first-graders playing musical chairs, always trying to out-anticipate the other as to what's going to happen right now,\" Sam Stovall, CFRA Research chief investment strategist, told CNBC on Friday.\n\nHe added that he's a big believer in Januarys being market indicators for the year ahead, and 2025 features an extra wrinkle because it's the first year of a new presidential term. President-elect Donald Trump will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, beginning his second stint in the White House.\n\nAccording to Stovall, when the market is higher in the January of the first year of a presidential term, it ends the year up by more than 18% on average, and notching a gain more than 90% of the time.\n\n\"So a pretty good indicator, if we get off on the right foot,\" he said on CNBC.\n\nAfter two straight years of S&P 500 gains that topped 20%, marking the best streak since 1998, traders are cautiously optimistic on 2025.\n\nAnalysts see more double-digit gains ahead, albeit less than last year. For his part, Stovall sees the S&P 500 up about 7%, which he described as still good—just not great.\n\nHistorically, there's some reason for concern in a year like 2025. Of the 11 bull markets since World War II that reached the two-year mark, the average gain for the third year was less than 3%, according to Stovall. And of those instances, three of them entered bear markets—meaning a 20% drop from a recent high—and two also saw declines.\n\nAlso based on the market's history since World War II, there's only a 1-in-5 chance of a third year of double-digit gains after two straight years with advances that big, he said.\n\nOther factors also look poised to slow down the bull market. The Federal Reserve has indicated it won't trim benchmark rates as much as previously anticipated. That's as inflation is expected to remain sticky, while Trump's plans for an immigration crackdown, tariffs, and tax cuts are seen adding upward pressure to prices.\n\nOn the other hand, market veteran Ed Yardeni thinks the U.S. is at the start of another \"roaring 20s\" era. Meanwhile, productivity has been improving amid an AI boom that looks to remain hot, with Microsoft forecasting investment in the sector of $80 billion this fiscal year.\n\n\"In many ways, artificial intelligence is the electricity of our age, and the next four years can build a foundation for America’s economic success for the next quarter century,\" Microsoft President Brad Smith said on Friday. \"The United States is poised to stand at the forefront of this new technology wave, especially if it doubles down on its strengths and effectively partners internationally.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

Founded in 1995, it is the sole registry for .com and .net domains and operates two of the 13 global internet root servers.\n\nAccording to Citi analysts, VeriSign is poised for a solid 2025. Citi assigned a $238 price target, which represents a potential upside of 16% from current levels. In its bull-case scenario, Citi sees VeriSign rising to $312, representing a potential upside of just over 50%.\n\n\"We view Verisign as being one of the safer plays in Internet with a narrower range of outcomes given its almost utility-like nature as a domain registry, ability to pass on regular price increases that leads to a resiliant top-line, and best in class EBITDA margins, providing what we believe to be an attractive risk/reward for investors,\" Citi says.\n\nVeriSign is one of the most profitable companies in the S&P 500.\n\nAccording to financial data as of the third quarter, the company is ranked fifth in the S&P 500 for the highest profit margin, at about 56%, tied with Nvidia. For operating margin, VeriSign is ranked third, and for gross margin, it's ranked 13th.\n\nCiti said it is encouraged by recent month-over-month growth in .com domain registrations, which could point to year-over-year growth in 2025.\n\n\"If trends continue to stabilize this way, and with pricing questions now in the rear-view, VRSN's discount to its historical peak will become more of a bullish driver,\" Citi said.\n\nVeriSign had a tough year, with the stock up just 2% compared to a 23% gain for the S&P 500. Meanwhile, the stock is down about 20% from its record high reached in December 2021.\n\nThat's left VeriSign trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 24x, which aligns with its 15-year historical average. VeriSign's price-to-earnings premium relative to the S&P 500 is 27% below its 15-year average and 52% below its peak.\n\nThe current valuation setup is what makes VeriSign a top stock pick for Citi.\n\n\"If Verisign were back on track for mid- to high-single-digit top-line growth (~5% pricing + ~2% volume), with high incremental margins, and continued share repurchase leading to double-digit EPS growth, shares at this level would prove cheap,\" Citi said.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

    "text": "A HELOC is a line of credit based on your home’s equity: The more equity (value) you’ve built up in the home, the more money you can access via a HELOC.\n\nA HELOC allows you to borrow exactly what you need, typically for lower rates than other forms of credit, and you only pay interest on what you borrow.\n\nOn the downside, HELOCs have variable interest rates, so your repayments will increase if rates rise.\n\nAnother risk: A HELOC uses your home as collateral, so if you don’t repay what you borrow, the lender could foreclose on it.\n\nResidential real estate just keeps on rising in value — and that means a home can be a valuable source of wealth to tap. One of the most popular ways to do so is via a home equity line of credit, or HELOC. Like a giant credit card, it allows you to borrow from your ownership stake (equity) as needed over a set timeframe, then repay it over decades. If you own a sizable amount of your home outright, you may have access to a five- or even six-figure sum — often, much more than you could borrow with a personal loan.\n\nThere’s a lot to like in a HELOC. However, it also comes with risks. You must put your home up as collateral, and you pay interest at a fluctuating rate — which means it could rise, boosting your repayments dramatically.\n\nLet’s look at all the pros and cons of a HELOC.\n\nLower interest rates\n\nFlexibility\n\nTax-deductible interest\n\nPotential boost to credit\n\nVariable rates/payments\n\nHouse on the line\n\nDiminished equity cushion\n\nPotential to run up balance quickly\n\nWhile home loan interest rates overall have risen dramatically since 2022, HELOC rates still tend to be lower than those on credit cards and personal loans. If you qualify for the best rates, a HELOC can be a less expensive way to consolidate debt or finance a home renovation.\n\nWith a HELOC, you use the funds as you need them, then repay only what you borrowed (with interest). If you wind up needing less cash than you thought, you’ll have smaller repayments, too. In contrast, home equity loans and personal loans offer a lump sum that has to be repaid in full (also with interest), whether you use all of the money or not.\n\nMost home equity lenders also offer flexibility in terms of how you access your HELOC funds, such as debit cards, checks, ATM withdrawals and online transfers. In addition, during the draw period, some allow you to convert all or a portion of your HELOC balance to a fixed rate, so you won’t risk getting hit with higher interest later on.\n\nAnother point of flexibility: repayment. Many lenders also offer an interest-only HELOC, which lets you pay just interest — no principal — during the draw period (typically 10 years). Doing so helps keep your payments manageable. Of course, you can always opt to pay back principal, all or in part, which in turn beefs up your available credit.\n\nEven after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, you can still deduct interest paid on a HELOC if you use the money for home renovations. Specifically, the IRS allows deductions on the interest if the HELOC funds are used to “buy, build or substantially improve the residence.” You can only take the deduction up to a certain threshold, however, based on your total mortgage debt. You must also itemize deductions to take advantage of this write-off.\n\nTwo of the most important components of your credit score are your payment history and credit mix. Adding a HELOC to your history and paying it on time can help boost your score. (However, keep in mind that changing your credit utilization ratio by taking on the HELOC could actually make your score go down, too.)\n\nHELOCs are for serious sums — at least five figures. Frequently, $10,000 is the smallest credit line you can establish. Many lenders also require a minimum initial withdrawal of at least that much.\n\nThe benchmark HELOC, whose rate Bankrate tracks, is for $30,000. There are lenders that offer credit lines as high as $750,000 or even $1 million.\n\nHow big your line of credit is, however, depends on the equity in your home — that is, how much of it you own outright. Generally, you can borrow up to 80 percent of your equity stake — sometimes as much as 90 percent, depending on the lender and your financials.\n\nHowever, your outstanding mortgage also impacts the amount of equity you can tap. When a lender says you can borrow up to 80 percent, they mean the sum total of all your home-based debt (current mortgage plus new HELOC) can’t exceed 80 percent of your home’s value. In financial-speak, this is called your combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV).\n\nFor example: Assume your home is worth $425,000 and your outstanding mortgage balance is $250,000. This means you have $175,000 in equity and a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 59 percent ($250,000 / $425,000 * 100). Your lender lets you borrow up to 80 percent of your equity. That means if the lender approves you for a HELOC, your maximum credit line is $90,000 ($425,000 *.80 – $250,000).\n\nWhile home equity loans come with a fixed interest rate, HELOCs have variable rates. This means that your rate can go up or down based on economic conditions,  the Fed’s monetary policy and other factors, which in turn affects your payments. Even if you take out a HELOC at a lower rate, you could face much higher interest rates when it comes time to repay.\n\n“Variable rates can turn your payments into a financial rollercoaster,” warns Linda Bell, senior writer on Bankrate’s home lending team. “What starts out as a bill you can handle can quickly spiral into unmanageable debt, putting your home at risk.”\n\nA HELOC is a secured loan, meaning it has collateral to back it — specifically, your home. It’s this collateral that allows the lender to charge less interest. However, it also means a risk for you: You’re putting your house on the line as a guarantee. “Because you are borrowing against your home, if you can’t make your monthly payments, you risk foreclosure,” says Sean Murphy, assistant vice president of mortgage operations, closing at Navy Federal Credit Union.\n\nWhen you borrow through a HELOC, you’re borrowing against your home’s equity. If home prices and property values drop, you could wind up owing more than your home is worth. In addition, if your home is your largest asset, tying up your equity with a HELOC might limit additional opportunities to borrow, as it depletes your net worth.\n\nBecause many HELOCs allow interest-only payments during the draw period, it’s easy to access cash without considering the financial ramifications. “If the borrower is not returning funds to this line of credit, then the loan eventually begins to amortize and the payments go up significantly,” says Joseph Polakovic, owner and CEO of Castle West Financial, a retirement-planning firm in San Diego. Bottom line: An unwelcome surprise can await you when the repayment period starts, if you haven’t expected/budgeted for a jump in your monthly payments.\n\nHELOCs generally have lower closing costs than home equity loans (they don’t require many common expenses, like title insurance). But watch out for other fees that can add up quickly. Most likely, you will have to pay an origination fee to open the credit line and an annual fee to keep the line open. The lender might charge to freeze the interest rate on a part of the draw. You might also be charged an early cancellation penalty, an inactivity fee if you don’t withdraw funds often enough, or (conversely) a fee every time you do — although the amounts will vary depending on the lender.\n\n“This underscores the importance of shopping around with lenders and comparing fees,” says Bell. “Some costs are not set in stone. Lenders want your business, so you might be able to negotiate some of them down before you sign on the dotted line.”\n\nHELOCs are ideal if you need to access cash over an extended period, especially if you aren’t sure how much you’ll need — say, for multi-phase home remodels that could span months or years. They can also work for more specific costs that you’ll incur over time with some regularity, like a child’s college tuition bills or an ongoing series of medical treatments.\n\nIf you’re looking to spend as you go, and only pay for what you’ve borrowed when you’ve borrowed it, a HELOC is probably a better option than a lump-sum home equity loan, says Murphy.\n\nIt’s not a good idea to open HELOCs for purely discretionary expenses: vacations, weddings/honeymoons or big-ticket items like cars, furniture or electronics that depreciate in value. Using them to pay off credit cards or other high-interest debt is doable, but debatable — a home equity loan (see below) might work better. While they can work as a short-term emergency fund, HELOCs shouldn’t be an ongoing supplement to a household budget, either — using them for everyday expenses just gets you deeper into debt.\n\nHowever, HELOCs can be risky. The variable interest rate could increase, and if you’re unable to pay back the loan for whatever reason, you could lose your home. In addition, you might end up with a false sense of bottomless funds during the draw period, which can make for a stark return to reality when the payback period begins.\n\nSome lenders assess a fee if you pay off and close your HELOC early — during the draw period, or soon into the repayment period. This penalty can be problematic if you want to retire your debt promptly, instead of taking 10 to 20 years to pay it off. And if you plan to sell your home soon, you could also be penalized since you’re required to repay the outstanding HELOC balance in full when the home changes title.\n\nHere are some loan alternatives to consider if a HELOC doesn’t sound right for you:\n\nHome equity loan: A home equity loan is similar to a HELOC, but instead of a credit line, it gives you a lump sum of cash. Repayments begin right away, at a fixed interest rate, meaning your monthly payment will never change. If you know exactly how much you need upfront, and plan to spend it promptly, a home equity loan could be a better option than a HELOC.\n\nCash-out refinance: A cash-out refinance replaces your existing mortgage with a new loan that has a bigger balance. You receive the difference in ready money, with the amount based on your home equity (many lenders allow you to borrow up to 80 percent of your home’s value). Generally, a cash-out refi is only a good idea if you can get a lower interest rate, afford the closing costs and plan to stay in your home for a long time.\n\nPersonal loan: Like home equity loans, personal loans come with a fixed monthly payment, a fixed interest rate and a lump sum of money upfront. The big difference between these loans and HELOCs is that personal loans are unsecured, so you don’t have to put your home or any other asset up as collateral. The catch is that they tend to come with higher interest rates than HELOCs, and you may not be able to borrow as much.\n\nHome equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are an option for disciplined borrowers who want to take advantage of the inherent wealth of their homes.  HELOCs have the most flexibility in terms of how much you can borrow and when you can pay it off, compared with other home equity products. Their structure can help you keep your monthly payments down and avoid unnecessary debt and interest.\n\nHowever, HELOCs also have a fluctuating rate, meaning you could pay a lot more in interest than you bargained for. And the sense of a seemingly limitless credit line could make them risky for less-disciplined borrowers.\n\nWhen considering a HELOC, think honestly about your financial habits, the potential risks and the nature of your funding needs. HELOCs work best if you require an indefinite sum or need funds for an extended period of time. And the money should go towards improving your home or your financial profile.\n\nAdditional reporting by Maya Dollarhide",

    "text": "Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nSaving money takes time and discipline — and it can be a challenge if you face competing financial obligations or unexpected costs. Your ability to save can also be impacted by external factors, including the rising cost of living and high interest rates on debt.\n\nAs of November 2024, the personal saving rate was 4.4%, down from 4.6% the previous year. With many Americans continuing to bear the brunt of inflation and higher costs in a post-pandemic economy, saving money could prove to be more challenging than it was just a few years ago. However, there are ways to reevaluate your current spending habits and cut costs to designate more toward your savings account.\n\nRead more: What is the average savings by age?\n\nThe most recent Consumer Expenditure Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that spending on groceries was up by 8.4% in 2022 (the most recent data available). Americans spend an average of $5,703 each year on food at home — nearly $500 monthly.\n\nOf course, you have to eat, so can’t completely eliminate this big monthly expense. That said, there are certainly ways to save money on groceries.\n\nMake a list before you shop: It can be easy to get lost in the colorful aisles of a grocery store and throw unnecessary snacks into your cart. Before you go shopping, take stock of what’s already in your refrigerator or pantry and make a list of your must-buy items. That way, you don’t buy duplicates or spend on groceries you don’t really need.\n\nShop generic: Name-brand products tend to come with higher prices. An easy way to cut grocery costs is to shop the supermarket’s brand of items. Chances are, the ingredients are pretty similar. And generic foods typically cost 25% to 30% less than their name-brand counterparts — which can really add up with each shopping trip.\n\nBuy in bulk: This may not make sense if you’re grocery shopping for one. But if you have a larger family, buying items in bulk can help you save big. However, be sure to calculate the price-per-unit (that’s the total number of units divided by the cost of the item) and ensure it’s less than the cost-per-unit when purchasing a smaller quantity. You’ll also want to consider the item’s shelf life and ensure your family can eat through your supply before it goes bad.\n\nConsider a rewards credit card: There are several rewards credit cards that offer cash back and bonuses for purchases made at supermarkets, as well as retailers, restaurants, gas stations, and more. Using a rewards card for grocery purchases that you need to make anyway can help you shave down the cost further. Just be sure you charge only what you can afford to repay at the end of the billing cycle. Otherwise, interest charges will wipe away those rewards — and then some.\n\nRead more: Best credit cards for groceries\n\nThe average monthly rent is $1,552 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, according to Apartments.com. However, there are several states where residents contend with even higher rates, especially those living in bustling metropolitan cities.\n\nFor example, the average monthly rent is $2,610 in New York, $2,465 in Massachusetts, and $2,150 in California.\n\nHigh rental costs can not only strain your budget but also make it more difficult to save and invest for the future. Here are a few ways you could lower your monthly rent:\n\nSign a longer lease: When a landlord has to spend time searching for a new tenant, they miss out on rental income. And with each new tenant, there’s a risk that they won’t stick to their payments. Standard leases tend to be about 12 months long, but signing a longer lease could entice them to lower your monthly rent in exchange for the guaranteed rental income for a longer period of time.\n\nNegotiate with your landlord: Having an honest conversation with your landlord can go a long way in negotiating your rent, especially if you have a proven track record of on-time payments and a stable income. It doesn’t hurt to ask.\n\nGet a roommate: If your monthly rent payment is too much for your budget to handle, getting a roommate can significantly reduce the financial burden. Just be sure to consult your landlord before taking on a roommate to ensure that it doesn’t violate the terms of your rental agreement.\n\nConsider a new location: Real estate is all about location, location, location. If your monthly rent is too high, moving to a more affordable neighborhood could help you trim your monthly rent. Take some time to explore other communities and see if the price difference could justify a new address. Moving could help you save further if you relocate to an area with low sales taxes or a state with no income taxes.\n\nAccording to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the median mortgage payment rose to $2,291 in 2024, up from from $2,032 the previous year. For many Americans, their monthly mortgage payment comprises a significant portion of their monthly expenses. Here’s how to save money on a mortgage:\n\nBuy down your mortgage rate: When taking out a mortgage, consider “buying down” your mortgage rate by paying more money up-front at closing. You’ll need to crunch the numbers to ensure this saves you money in the long run. For example, if you plan to sell your home in a few years, you may not come out ahead. But reducing the interest rate on your forever home by even 1% could save you thousands of dollars over time.\n\nMake an extra payment each year: Splitting your monthly mortgage payment in half and making a bi-weekly payment, rather than one monthly payment, will result in one extra payment each year. By doing this, you’ll build equity and reduce your principal balance more quickly, lowering the total amount of interest you pay on your loan over time.\n\nRefinance your mortgage: Refinancing involves replacing your existing home loan with a new mortgage for the same property but with new terms. If you can secure a lower interest rate, you’ll enjoy a lower monthly payment and long-term interest savings. Again, it’s important to do the math and ensure any closing costs or a longer repayment period don’t cancel out those savings.\n\nUtility costs can creep up unexpectedly if you’re not monitoring your usage, especially when temperatures reach extremes during the summer and winter months. However, you can keep your energy costs low with a few smart moves:\n\nLower your usage: Taking shorter showers, using warm or cold water, and unplugging electronics when you’re not using them are just a few ways to reduce your energy consumption and, in turn, lower your monthly utility bill.\n\nRepair leaks: Leaky pipes result in using more water, while cracks in your windows or door frame can require more energy to keep your home the right temperature. Taking the time to seal off any leaks and better insulate your home will help reduce your bills.\n\nInvest in energy-efficient appliances: Making this swap not only reduces your carbon footprint, but also has a direct impact on your energy bills. These appliances may involve a higher upfront cost, but typically require less energy and resources to run, which is good news for your wallet long-term. Plus, you may qualify for rebates and tax incentives when purchasing Energy Star products.\n\nCar payments, insurance, fuel costs, and repairs can add up. The American Automobile Association estimates that the total cost to own and operate a new vehicle was $12,297 per year, or $1,024.71 a month, as of 2024. That’s up from the previous year, when the average annual cost was $12,182, or $1,015 per month.\n\nMaking a few changes to your daily habits can help you reduce your transportation costs and put more money toward your savings account each month.\n\nOpt for an alternative mode of transportation: Walking, biking, skateboarding, and rollerblading are all more affordable ways to get around. For short trips around town, leave your car at home and try a fuel-free alternative. You’ll not only save money but maybe even enjoy some health benefits.\n\nTake public transportation: If you live in an area with reliable public transportation options, take advantage of your local bus or subway. Your employer may even offer a stipend or discount to subsidize your commuter costs.\n\nCarpool: Consider creating a carpool group with friends or coworkers and split the cost of fuel if you’re all headed in the same direction.\n\nLook for fuel savings through apps: If you absolutely have to drive to your destination, there are several apps such as GasBuddy and Waze that can point you in the direction of the most affordable fuel near you.\n\nInsurance provides a financial safety net in the event of a car accident, natural disaster, medical emergency, and more. Depending on the number of assets you’re paying to insure and their value, monthly premiums can add up. A few easy ways to save include:\n\nBundle insurance policies: Many insurance providers offer savings for customers who bundle insurance policies. For example, say you need auto and home insurance — purchasing policies from the same company could get you a discount.\n\nAsk your insurance provider if you qualify for any discounts: Insurance providers often reward customers who pose the least amount of risk. For example, maintaining a clean driving record with no accidents could help you qualify for a good driver discount from your auto insurance provider. Ask your insurance company about the specific discounts they offer to see if you can trim your bill that way.\n\nShop around and consider different insurance providers: Insurance companies typically offer free quotes online. So do some research and request quotes from several providers to compare rates and choose the best coverage and rate. This is something you can do every couple of years to evaluate your current policies, not just when shopping for a new one.\n\nThe average cost of college in the United States is $38,270 per student per year, including books, supplies, and daily living expenses, according to the most recent figures from the Education Data Initiative (EDI). And the data shows that the cost of tuition has only increased in recent decades, with college costs more than doubling in the 21st century. Fortunately, there are ways to keep these costs down:\n\nApply for scholarships: There are thousands of scholarships available each year, and they’re not all based on financial need or academic performance. There’s probably a scholarship (or several) based on your unique situation and background. So spend time researching and applying for scholarships offered by the college you’re attending, local organizations, national foundations, and private entities to save money on college.\n\nConsider a public university or community college rather than a private institution: Private college costs are significantly higher than public college at $58,628 per year for tuition and on-campus living expenses, according to the EDI. Opting for a public university or community college can shave thousands of dollars off your total bill.\n\nCommute if you attend a university that’s close enough to home: Commuting to a university involves its own set of costs, but it doesn’t compare to the cost of on-campus housing at a four-year college or university. If you live close enough to your university, consider living at home or renting a cheaper apartment off-campus and commuting to school.\n\nTake advantage of student discounts: One of the major perks of being a college student is the long list of discounts you may qualify for from major retailers, restaurants, streaming platforms, tech providers, and more.\n\nTraveling can be a fulfilling way to spend your time and make new memories. However, depending on your desired destination, funding your travels can kill your budget. This doesn’t mean you have to put your goal of traveling on the back burner. There are plenty of ways to make your travel plans more affordable:\n\nUse a travel credit card: Travel credit cards can offer discounts on hotel stays, airfare, luggage fees, travel insurance, rental cars, and more. Some may even grant you access to airport lounges that offer their own set of freebies while you wait to board your flight. Choose a card that rewards you for your regular spending and helps you earn cash back, points, or miles that can later be put toward your travel costs. Keep in mind, however, that the more perks a card comes with, the higher the annual fee may be. And carrying a balance results in interest charges that cancel out those savings and rewards. So choose your card and spend wisely.\n\nTravel in the off-season: Airfare and hotel rates can skyrocket during peak travel times, such as during the summer months and surrounding major holidays. An easy way to save money on travel is to have flexible travel dates and be open to traveling during the off-season.\n\nBook travel plans in advance: Last-minute travel deals exist, but if you’re hoping to plan a trip that fits neatly into your budget, it may not be wise to wait until the last minute to book your flight or hotel. As soon as you’ve decided to take a trip, you can sign up for alerts from your preferred hotels and airlines to be notified when there’s a sale or when fares are lower than usual. Giving yourself a decent lead time can help you secure the best rate and factor your travel costs into your monthly budget.\n\nIt’s estimated that raising a child through age 17 costs more than $300,000. From basic necessities such as healthcare, food, and education to miscellaneous expenses such as dance classes and birthday parties, there are many reasons why having kids is expensive.\n\nIf you’re thinking about starting a family or already have kids, here are some ways to cut costs:\n\nBuy secondhand: Children outgrow their clothing quickly and are more likely to have spills and dirty their clothes. Instead of buying brand-new clothing, check out your local thrift store or consignment shop. Chances are these items will be more reasonably priced than something off the rack.\n\nTake advantage of free activities in your area: Following community pages on social media and signing up for emails from your local libraries and museums can help you keep tabs on what’s happening in your area and find free events and activities for your kids.\n\nStay on top of preventative care: Scheduling regular check-ups and vaccinations will prevent more serious and costly health issues down the road. If your child needs medication, ask for generic versions, which are often cheaper than brand names. And if your employer offers a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) you can use pre-tax income to pay for qualifying medical expenses.\n\nBuying yourself a new pair of shoes or splurging on a pampering session can be a nice way to treat yourself — and it doesn’t have to impact your ability to save. You can still treat yourself on a budget with these tips:\n\nJoin store loyalty programs: If you’re a frequent shopper at a particular store, ask if they have any loyalty programs. You may earn freebies or discounts just by sticking with certain retailers or brands.\n\nSign up for emails: Many retailers have email lists they use to make customers aware of upcoming, and often exclusive, promotions. You may also be able to sign up for text alerts to find out about sales and receive coupons.\n\nInstall browser extensions: Browser extensions such as Honey and Rakuten do the heavy lifting for you. These tools automatically find and apply coupons at checkout when you shop online. They also offer cash back at certain retailers, further reducing the total cost.\n\nTax time can be stressful, especially if you think you will owe a bill in April. The good news is there are several ways to cut down your tax liability:\n\nMax out retirement contributions: Increasing contributions to your 401(k), IRA, or other retirement plan lowers your taxable income. In 2025, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $23,500; if you’re 50 or older, you can set aside an additional $7,500 per year. Your employer may also offer matching contributions, which is free money that doesn’t count toward your annual maximum. So even if you don’t max out your contributions, be sure to save enough to receive your full match.\n\nPut money in a health savings account (HSA): Contributions to a health savings account are also tax-deductible and help lower your overall taxable income. Plus, the money can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses. And unlike an FSA, any money you have left over at the end of the year rolls over to the next.\n\nLook for deductions and credits: Unless you’re a tax expert, you probably aren’t aware of all the tax write-offs available to you. According to Turbo Tax, some of the most commonly overlooked deductions and credits include state sales taxes, student loan interest, moving expenses, and the Child Tax credit. Fortunately, there are tax software programs that can help you identify possible write-offs. When it doubt, though, it can be worth paying a tax professional to complete your return so you don’t miss anything.\n\nRead more: How to save $10,000 in a year\n\nBetween food, toys, training, and other supplies, the cost of caring for your pet can add up. According to a 2024 MetLife survey, the average pet owner spends $4,800 on their pet each year. These extra expenses can certainly put a dent in your budget, but there are ways to keep those costs down.\n\nGet a pet insurance policy: Pet insurance can help you cover the costs of medical care for your pet, including checkups and medication. According to the North American Pet Health Insurance Association, the average cost of a pet insurance premium is between $9 and $57 per month, depending on the type of animal and coverage that you have. That could end up being worth it if your pet needs emergency surgery or treatment for a major medical issue.\n\nBuy pet supplies in bulk: If your pet typically eats the same food and snacks, or you use certain care products on a regular basis, buying those items in bulk can help you save more on each individual item in the long run.\n\nLearn to groom your own pet: Pet grooming can be expensive, especially if you have a dog or cat that requires regular visits. Learning to perform basic grooming tasks — like nail trims and baths — can save you a trip to the groomers and cut down on your pet-related expenses (though you may still want to visit a professional for haircuts, dematting, and other more involved services).\n\nEntertainment costs may be the first line item to go if you’re looking for areas in your budget to cut costs. However, just because you’re looking to save doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice all of your non-essential expenses. You might consider:\n\nCut the cord: If you still pay for cable, consider swapping it for a streaming service instead. For a flat monthly fee, you can have access to a large library of content that you may be able to download for offline viewing, too.\n\nBundle your streaming services: Of course, subscribing to multiple streaming platforms can be just as expensive as a premium cable package. So look for bundling opportunities (like Hulu's Disney+ and Max bundle) or prioritize one or two platforms that offer your must-see shows and movies.\n\nJoin rewards or membership programs: Movie theaters, performance centers, and other entertainment venues may offer rewards or membership programs to help you save. For a monthly fee, you could gain access to discounted tickets and concessions, special events, and more.\n\nGrowing your savings account balance takes time and careful planning, but with the right strategy, you can build up enough savings to cover all of your financial goals and long-term expenses.\n\nAs you put in the hard work to build your savings, here are some ways you can maximize those efforts:\n\nIf you don’t have a budget in place (or haven’t evaluated it in a while), you may be spending more than necessary. Streaming accounts you forgot you subscribed to, a few too many DoorDash orders, or a gym membership you no longer use are all extra expenses you could easily eliminate.\n\nReview your budget and bank statements carefully to see if there are spending categories you could trim down to allocate more money toward your savings goals.\n\nRead more: Need a new budgeting tool? Try one of these 5 Mint alternatives\n\nAutomating transfers from your checking account to your savings account ensures you’re making regular contributions your balance continues to grow over time. Plus, by setting-and-forgetting your savings contributions, you may not even notice the money has left your account in the first place.\n\nWhere you keep your savings is just as important as the amount you’re contributing. The national average interest rate for a savings account is only 0.42%, according to the FDIC. However, there are other options that can help your savings grow faster.\n\nFor example, consider putting your money in a high-yield savings account or certificate of deposit (CD), which may pay as much as 4% APY or more. You could be missing out on extra savings by not exploring high-yield account options.\n\nUnexpected financial emergencies can throw your savings off track and result in debt. By creating an emergency fund, you won’t have to worry about a car repair or trip to the emergency room throwing your financial plan off course.\n\nRead more: How much money should I have in an emergency savings account?\n\nPaying off high-interest debt (such as credit cards) can free up room in your monthly budget to put more toward savings. In fact, eliminating debt that accumulates interest is essentially saving money, especially when your debt interest rates are much higher than your savings interest rates.\n\nUsing a debt repayment strategy such as the snowball or avalanche method can help you get the ball rolling and save money on interest over time.\n\nTreating saving money like a game can help you stay motivated. Try a savings challenge such as the 52-week challenge or no-spend challenge to give your balance a boost.\n\nKeeping track of transactions, categorizing expenses, and monitoring progress toward your goals can be a lot of work. Fortunately, there are plenty of money-saving apps that can do a lot of the heavy lifting for you. Signing up for one of these apps can help you be more strategic about saving and staying on track.\n\nRead more: How to use AI to improve your finances\n\nIn honor of International Women’s Day, we’re breaking down some of the major challenges women face when it comes to saving money and offering our expert tips for overcoming them.\n\nSavings accounts protect your money and allow you to earn interest.

    "text": "The ongoing high-rate environment may feel frustrating for people hoping to buy a home or refinance their mortgage. But there is good news: Mortgage rates are down week over week.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has decreased by five basis points since this time last week and now sits at 6.67%. The 15-year fixed rate has dropped by 12 basis points to 6.00%.\n\nDig deeper: 2025 housing market — Is it a good time to buy a house?\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\n30-year fixed: 6.67%\n\n20-year fixed: 6.51%\n\n15-year fixed: 6.00%\n\n5/1 ARM: 6.68%\n\n7/1 ARM: 6.65%\n\n30-year VA: 6.08%\n\n15-year VA: 5.63%\n\n5/1 VA: 6.23%\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\n30-year fixed: 6.65%\n\n20-year fixed: 6.62%\n\n15-year fixed: 5.89%\n\n5/1 ARM: 6.04%\n\n7/1 ARM: 6.68%\n\n30-year VA: 6.05%\n\n15-year VA: 5.77%\n\n5/1 VA: 5.97%\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nRead more: Is now a good time to refinance your mortgage?\n\nUse the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator to see how various mortgage terms and interest rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nOur calculator also considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when determining your estimated monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a more realistic idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThe average 30-year mortgage rate today is 6.67%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is lower than with a shorter-term loan.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 6.00% today. When deciding between a 15-year and a 30-year mortgage, consider your short-term versus long-term goals.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to accumulate. But the trade-off is that your monthly payment will be higher as you pay off the same amount in half the time.\n\nLet’s say you get a $300,000 mortgage. With a 30-year term and a 6.67% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,930, and you’d pay $394,752 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage but with a 15-year term and 6.00% rate, your monthly payment would jump up to $2,532. But you’d only pay $155,683 in interest over the years.\n\nWith a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for the entire life of your loan. You will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage, though.\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a predetermined period of time. Then, the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remaining 23 years of your term.\n\nAdjustable rates typically start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, it’s possible your rate will go up. Lately, though, some fixed rates have been starting lower than adjustable rates. Talk to your lender about its rates before choosing one or the other.\n\nDig deeper: Fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, great or excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So, if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nWaiting for rates to drop probably isn’t the best method to get the lowest mortgage rate right now unless you are truly in no rush and don’t mind waiting until the end of 2024 or into 2025. If you’re ready to buy, focusing on your personal finances is probably the best way to lower your rate.\n\nTo find the best mortgage lender for your situation, apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four companies. Just be sure to apply to all of them within a short time frame — doing so will give you the most accurate comparisons and have less of an impact on your credit score.\n\nWhen choosing a lender, don’t just compare interest rates. Look at the mortgage annual percentage rate (APR) — this factors in the interest rate, any discount points, and fees. The APR, which is also expressed as a percentage, reflects the true annual cost of borrowing money. This is probably the most important number to look at when comparing mortgage lenders.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.67%, and the average 15-year mortgage rate is 6.00%. But these are national averages, so the average in your area could be different. Averages are typically higher in expensive parts of the U.S. and lower in less expensive areas.\n\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.67% right now, according to Zillow. However, you might get an even better rate with an excellent credit score, sizable down payment, and low debt-to-income ratio (DTI).\n\nMortgage rates aren't expected to drop drastically in the near future, though they may inch down here and there.\n\nA rate-and-term refinance replaces your original mortgage with a new one with a different mortgage rate and term length. Find out if it’s a good fit.\n\nHow do you know when to refinance your mortgage? Lower interest rates are only one sign that it could be time.

However, the unemployment rate also ticked higher in the month.\n\nAfter cutting interest rates in three consecutive meetings, Federal Reserve officials will be closely examining the jobs data for signs of underlying weakness in the labor market. A strong jobs report, along with worsening inflation data, could give officials a tough decision on whether to cut again rates when the Fed next meets in late January.\n\nComing earlier in the week is ADP private-sector employment data. The Labor Department moved up the release date for weekly initial jobless claims to Wednesday.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will release the minutes for its December meeting of the FOMC. The meeting notes will provide insight into officials’ deliberations, which included a dissenting vote on the central bank’s decision to again cut interest rates at its final meeting of the year. Investors will also hear from several Federal Reserve speakers, including Federal Reserve Govs. Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker and Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid.\n\nOther noteworthy data releases this week include Friday’s preliminary report on consumer sentiment in December, trade deficit data and service sector Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) surveys on Tuesday and consumer credit updates on Wednesday.\n\nHuang is scheduled to speak Monday evening in Las Vegas, where the spotlight will be on Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs, which are used to power generative artificial intelligence (AI) processes like large language models (LLMs).\n\nAnalysts at Citi said in late November that they expect Nvidia to raise sales expectations for Blackwell as the company works to meet what Huang has called “insane” demand. On Nvidia’s earnings call in November, Huang said Nvidia expects to deliver more Blackwell platforms in the current quarter than previously estimated.\n\nCiti also expects Huang to discuss a demand inflection in AI robotics “around warehouses, manufacturing, and humanoid AI robots.” The company may also discuss Rubin, a successor to Blackwell chips that Huang unveiled in June and said would release in 2026.\n\nCES comes after Nvidia’s stock wrapped up a stellar 2024. Despite shares entering correctiont territory last month, Nvidia stock surged about 170% in 2024 as Big Tech customers—including Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google—beefed up their AI data-center and cloud computing infrastructure. Last year's big gain for Nvidia came on the heels of a 240% stock-price increase in 2023.\n\nSeveral corporate earnings reports are scheduled for release this week, including a handful that were moved from Thursday due to the markets closure for the national day of mourning.\n\nDelta Air Lines will report its quarterly earnings on Friday following a disappointing quarter that was dragged down by a global IT outage resulting in costs of around $500 million. However, the airline said that it expects increased travel from premium consumers in 2025.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cal-Maine Foods will report earnings as rising egg prices sent its prior quarterly revenue higher by more than 70% as strains of bird flu have helped send egg prices higher in recent months.\n\nThe Wednesday report from Albertsons comes as it ended its merger agreement with Kroger (KR) after a federal court blocked the proposed merger between the grocery-store chains.\n\nJefferies Financial Group, which operates a similar business model to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) conglomerate, is scheduled to release its quarterly financial data on Wednesday.\n\nThe Friday report from Walgreens Boots Alliance comes amid reports of the possible sale of the struggling pharmacy chain to a private equity firm.\n\nOther noteworthy reports this week include beer maker Constellation Brands, industrial chemical producers RPM International and WD-40, and home builder KB Home.\n\nRead the original article on Investopedia",

Act now before it's gone ⏰\n\nNot in 2025.  The first week will be packed with market-moving events and reports, including:\n\nRelated: 2024 domestic box office falls to $8.7 billion for first time since COVID-19\n\nThe Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas (running basically all week).\n\nMinutes from the Federal Reserve meeting in December.\n\nThe big December jobs report.\n\nThe start of the fourth-quarter 2024 earnings season.\n\nAll of this in the context of two realities:\n\nStocks had a great 2024 but sagged a bit in December as interest rates climbed.\n\nThe inauguration of Donald Trump for a second presidential term is coming in three weeks, and what policies he will implement are still not clear.\n\nFirst up: Jensen Huang at the Consumer Electronics Show\n\nThe founder and CEO of  (NVDA) , the chipmaker most identified with artificial intelligence, will be Monday's keynote speaker at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.\n\nRelated: Analysts make Nvidia, AMD predictions ahead of Consumer Electronics Show\n\nThis is techland's big trade show, where companies showcase their latest products and offer hints of what's to come. About 130,000 people and 3,500 exhibitors will attend.\n\nHuang will speak at 6:20 p.m. PT Monday at the Mandalay Bay Arena. He is expected to unveil a new super-fast graphics card that gamers and others have been waiting for and updates on the shipping schedules of the Blackwell family of graphic processing units. These are the products developers of artificial intelligence applications, including large language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, have been salivating for.\n\nHuang will speak not as an all-conquering hero but as one whose company's shares soared 239% in 2023 but then had to weather a volatile 2024.\n\nNvidia was twice the world's most valuable company. The shares rose 173% between the end of 2023 and June 18. They fell 27.5% between June 18 and Aug. 7. And rallied 35.8% between Aug. 7 and Dec. 31.\n\nFor all that, the shares ended up 171.2% for the year — where they were in June.\n\nIn the two days since New Year's, Nvidia's stock price jumped an additional 7.6%.\n\nThe CES conference officially starts on Tuesday and ends on Friday. One of the presentations many are looking for highlights laptops using Microsoft  (MSFT)  Windows and CoPilot, Microsoft's AI program.  Manufacturers including Lenovo, HP, Dell, Samsung, Acer, and Asus are working on new machines.\n\nThe Labor Department's jobs report is normally the first Friday of the month. The 2024 holiday calendar forced a week's delay.\n\nThe consensus is that the report will show 153,000 new jobs created in December 2024, with the unemployment rate holding at 4.2%, the same level as November. Look for the revisions on the most recent report, which said 227,000 jobs were created in November.\n\nThe jobs situation has moderated since June because many companies haven't needed to add staff. A bigger issue is that many companies, especially restaurants, bars, and other retail stores, have been cutting staff.\n\nIn addition, many jobs are dependent on a healthier real estate market. But rates on 30-year mortgages have been holding steadily at or just below 7%, the highest levels since July, despite recent Fed interest rate cuts.\n\nIf you're trying to predict where interest rates might be headed, the minutes of the Federal Reserve's December 17-18 meeting will provide some hints. They will be released Wednesday at 2 p.m.\n\nAt the December meeting, the Fed cut its key interest rate a quarter point to 4.25% to 4.5%, but Chairman Jerome Powell cautioned against thinking the central bank will be cutting rates rapidly in 2025.\n\nIndeed, bond markets have been balking at pushing rates lower. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has risen from 3.623% before the Fed's September meeting to 4.602% as of Friday.\n\nThe problem is the continued stickiness of inflation. No one can say exactly what the problem is except shelter costs aren't falling and food prices are getting hit by odd things like bird flu. Bond investors are worried about U.S. government finances and the huge borrowings needed to keep the government operating.\n\nThe inflation stickiness has pushed the rates on 30-year mortgages to just about 7% from about 6.1% in early September.\n\nThe rate increase adds about $165 a month — nearly 11% — to the principal-and-interest payment on a $250,000 mortgage.\n\nAnyone looking to buy or sell a home is painfully aware of the dilemma. If inflation erupts in 2025, the pain will be worse.\n\nThe week will be disrupted on Thursday when stock markets and markets that trade stock derivatives close for former President Jimmy Carter's funeral.\n\nThe markets for Treasury securities will be open for just a half day. Futures markets that are not tied to stocks will operate as usual.\n\nThe earnings season starts this week and will pick up rapidly as January progresses.\n\nThis week's reports include second-quarter results on Tuesday from Cal-Maine Foods  (CALM) , the nation's largest commercial producer of eggs. Analysts will want to know what problems the latest bird-flu outbreak has caused for the Mississippi-based company company.\n\nEgg supplies nationally are tight, and prices have been rising. Cal-Maine's commercial egg-producing farms have been able to meet demand and enjoy higher prices. Shares jumped 79.3% in 2024 and 4.5% on Thursday and Friday.\n\nDelta Air Lines  (DAL)  reports on Friday morning. The big airline shares were up 50% in 2024. The company has been able to capitalize on increasing business travel demand and, as important, increasing demand from high-income consumers.

    "text": "We’re off the starting blocks in 2025 now, with the holidays behind us and another twelve months ahead, making this a perfect time to set up a well-balanced portfolio. The best investing approaches will include a variety of strategies: low- and high-risk, growth and value, momentum-driven plays, and passive strategies such as dividend investing.\n\nDiscover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener\n\nThat last deserves a closer look. It’s usually seen as a defensive strategy, not a usual approach at a time of strongly rising markets – but dividends provide a steady income stream, which is a vital attribute for any investing strategy.\n\nWith that in mind, let’s explore some dividend stocks that encountered headwinds in 2024 but now appear attractive according to Janney Montgomery analyst Jason Stewart.\n\nThese dividend payers not only promise reliable income but also boast impressive yields starting at 14%. Let’s take a closer look, leveraging Stewart’s insights to uncover what makes them compelling investment choices.\n\nCherry Hill Mortgage (CHMI)\n\nFirst up is Cherry Hill Mortgage, a real estate investment trust (REIT) that focuses its activities on building a diversified, hybrid residential mortgage portfolio. Since its founding in 2013, the company has invested in mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) and residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs), with the aim of providing its own shareholders with sound risk-adjusted returns plus additional opportunities for capital appreciation.\n\nCherry Hill has built its portfolio through multiple strategies. These include the acquisition of servicing-related assets by bulk purchase from mortgage servicers; the leveraged opportunistic acquisition and management of agency RMBSs; the purchase of both fixed- and floating-rate non-agency RMBSs; and effective hedging and risk management. The company announced this past November that it had completed its conversion to an internally managed REIT.\n\nAs a REIT, Cherry Hill is subject to tax regulations governing the return of profits directly to shareholders – and that is directly responsible for the company’s status as a dividend champ. REITs frequently use dividend payments as a vehicle for regulatory profit return compliance. Cherry Hill’s dividend history stretches back to the final quarter of 2013, and while the company has adjusted the payment as necessary over this period, it has never missed a quarterly payment.\n\nIn the most recent dividend declaration, made on December 12, Cherry Hill set a 4Q24 payment of 15 cents per common share. This dividend is scheduled for payment this coming January 31; at the current rate, the annualized payment of 60 cents per common share gives a forward yield of 23%.\n\nThe dividend is supported by Cherry Hill’s combination of earnings and assets. The company’s last reported quarter, the third quarter of 2024, showed non-GAAP earnings of 8 cents per share, as well as unrestricted cash reserves of $50.2 million. The company had a book value of $4.02 per share.\n\nFor Janney’s Jason Stewart, Cherry Hill shows a strong profile for dividend investors. The analyst sees the company in a position to keep delivering reliable results.\n\n“CHMI employs an agency plus MSR investment strategy, which we expect will deliver superior risk-adjusted returns on a through cycle basis. In addition, the company recently completed a strategic review and internalized management of the company leading to alignment of interests with shareholders. We expect BVPS to be driven by the agency MBS portion of the portfolio near term with the MSR investment providing substantial cash carry. The company’s internal management structure is one of several factors that should drive earnings coverage of the dividend, and the overly discounted valuation makes for an attractive entry point,” Stewart opined.\n\nTo this end, Stewart rates Cherry Hill with a Buy rating, and his price target of $4 implies a runway toward ~53% upside for 2025. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~76% potential total return profile. (To watch Stewart’s track record, click here)\n\nREIT stocks don’t always get a lot of analyst attention – they tend to fly under the radar. However, there are two reviews on file here and both are to Buy, making the consensus rating a Moderate Buy. CHMI shares are priced at just $2.62, with an average price target of $4. (See CHMI stock forecast)\n\nAngel Oak Mortgage (AOMR)\n\nNext on our list is another REIT, Angel Oak Mortgage. This is an externally managed company, and its real estate activities are focused on acquiring first-lien, non-QM loans, along with other mortgage-related assets, from the US real estate and mortgage scene. Angel Oak’s investments in these assets are directed at producing attractive returns for its own investors.\n\nAngel Oak has built a portfolio based on a vertically integrated plan for both asset management and mortgage lending. The company has its hands in all aspects of this business, from sourcing and underwriting loans, to loan acquisition, to asset allocation and portfolio management, and it monitors its own performance to ensure that it creates a cycle of long-term gains for its investors and shareholders.\n\nA key point that sets Angel Oak apart from its peers in the mortgage REIT landscape is its affiliation with the Angel Oak mortgage origination company. This affiliation allows the REIT to use an ‘originator model’ in its loan sourcing, rather than depending on purchasing or otherwise acquiring loans and mortgage assets from third parties in an aggregator model. Angel Oak reaps a number of advantages from this model, chief among them being greater accuracy in the company’s risk and return analyses.\n\nTurning to the dividend, we find that Angel Oak last declared the payment on November 6, in the amount of 32 cents per common share. At the annualized rate of $1.28 per share, this dividend gives a robust yield of 14%. The company last paid out its dividend on November 27.\n\nIn 3Q24, the last period for which Angel Oak has reported results, the company saw a net interest income of $9 million, up 22% year-over-year. Also of interest, Angel Oak’s GAAP net income, at $31.2 million, came to $1.29 per share. The company did run a net loss when measuring distributable earnings, of 14 cents per share; this did not, however, stop the company from keeping up its dividend payment.\n\nFor analyst Stewart, in his coverage for Janney, the key here is that Angel Oak has a solid niche position.\n\n“AOMR is attractively positioned as a leader in the non-QM space, which is expected to experience exponential growth over the next several years. The company has a well-structured balance sheet, solid credit performance, and the capacity and flexibility through its partnership with its affiliated lender to invest and expand with the growing non-QM market. Active rotation of the shareholder base has created a buying opportunity at the same time ROEs remain in the mid-double-digit range. We expect mid-single-digit growth in GAAP BVPS and multiple expansion toward economic BVPS,” Stewart stated.\n\nSaying that the best is yet to come for this stock, Stewart puts a Buy rating on the share. He complements that with a $13 price target, enough to suggest a 36% appreciation for the coming year. Taken together with the dividend yield, this stock’s total 12-month return may reach as high as 40%.\n\nOverall, Angel Oak’s stock has earned a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 5 recent reviews that break down to 3 Buys and 2 Holds. The shares are priced at $9.53 and their $11.83 average price target implies a potential one-year upside of 24%.

    "text": "US stocks have been slumping heading into the first full-on week of 2025.\n\nIn the past five trading sessions, the S&P 500 is down more than 1.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite is off nearly 2%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is lower by about 1.5%.\n\nIn the week ahead, a crucial run of labor market data is set to greet investors, with Friday morning's December jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics serving as the week's most important release. Updates on job openings and private wage growth, as well as readings on activity in the services sectors, are also on the schedule.\n\nThat data will provide a final snapshot of the labor market before the Fed's next meeting on Jan. 30-31.\n\nIn corporate news, investors will watch for key announcements from tech companies such as Nvidia (NVDA) during the Consumer Electronics Show. Meanwhile, Delta (DAL) and Constellation Brands (STZ) are expected to report quarterly results.\n\nAnother shortened week of stock trading lies ahead with markets closed Thursday to mourn the death of former President Jimmy Carter.\n\nThe labor market cooled in 2024, but the Federal Reserve appears confident in its trajectory.\n\nIn his final press conference of the year on Dec. 18, Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the labor market overall as \"good,\" noting that the \"downside risks\" that emerged in the summer of 2024 as the unemployment rate spiked \"appear to have diminished.\"\n\n\"The labor market is now looser than pre-pandemic, and it’s clearly still cooling further, so far in, in a gradual and orderly way,\" Powell said. \"We don’t think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to 2%.\"\n\nEconomists expect incoming data to show more gradual cooling. The December jobs report is expected to show the US labor market added 153,000 jobs in the month, down from the 227,000 seen in November. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.2%.\n\n\"The labor market is on solid footing, but employment growth slowed and overall labor market conditions cooled in 2024,\" Morgan Stanley US economist Sam Coffin wrote in a note to clients. \"The good news is the labor market is not softening as suddenly as it appeared to do last summer.\"\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, markets were pricing in just an 11% chance the Fed cuts rates at its January meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nThe CES tech conference kicks off on Monday with a keynote speech from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. An analyst question and answer session is also slated for Tuesday.\n\nNvidia stock is down more than 1% since reporting earnings after the bell on Nov. 20 amid concerns over delays of shipments of its new Blackwell chip. Nvidia shares still ended 2024 up more than 150%.\n\nBank of America’s Vivek Arya told Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast Thursday that broader market forces and company-specific issues drove the sell-off in Nvidia stock late last year. \"What we have seen in the market is a rotation of money from semiconductors to software,\" Arya said, noting that the latter was less exposed to US trade restrictions on goods to and from China.\n\nHe added that for Nvidia, \"the last two quarters have not been clean, really, because they're going through growing pains from one generation of product that was Hopper to the new generation of product.\"\n\nThe historically best seven-day stretch of the year for the S&P 500 came and went without any gains. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has risen 1.3% during the seven trading days beginning Dec. 24 amid the so-called Santa Claus rally.\n\nBut this year, the index fell about 0.5%. LPL Financial chief technical strategist Adam Turnquist wrote in a note to clients that when the S&P 500 has a negative return over this time period, it usually points to a weaker year for stocks.\n\nThough, as we noted last week, last year didn't feature a Santa Claus rally either, and the S&P 500 still rose roughly 24% in 2025.\n\n\"I don't know how far the market falls from here,\" Ritholtz Wealth Management chief market strategist Callie Cox told Yahoo Finance. \"I certainly don't assign too much weight to seasonal patterns. Just because the market is falling during the Santa Claus rally period doesn't mean that we're doomed.\"\n\nOne key catalyst could come with next week's jobs report. As a recent rise in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) near 4.6% has helped contribute to the sour sentiment around stocks, Piper Sandler chief markets strategist Michael Kantrowitz believes relief could be on the way.\n\n\"We think we need to see softer employment to get rates to start coming down,\" Kantrowitz said in a video to clients on Friday.\n\nWhether the soft data comes in the week ahead or later in the first quarter, Kantrowitz believes this narrative shift from the rising rate environment could help \"get equities going once again.\"\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, December final (58.3 expected, 58.5 previously); S&P Global US composite PMI, December final (56.6 previously); Factory Orders, November (-0.3% expected, +0.2% prior); Durable Goods Orders, November final (-0.3% expected, -1.1% prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings releases.\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Job openings, November (7.7 million expected, 7.74 million previously); ISM Services Index, December (53.1 expected, 52.1 prior)\n\nEarnings: Cal-Maine Foods (CALM)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Jan. 3; ADP Private Payrolls, December (+130,000 expected, +146,000 previously); FOMC December meeting minutes\n\nEarnings: Albertsons (ACI), Helen of Troy (HELE), Jefferies (JEF)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, December (+26.8% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ending Jan. 4 (211,000 previously)\n\nEarnings: KB Home (KBH)\n\nNYSE and Nasdaq close to mark national day of mourning for former President Jimmy Carter.

    "text": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day\n\nWhat we're watching\n\nWhat we're reading\n\nEconomic data releases and earnings\n\nIn the past 10 years of my life, a few things have been constant.\n\nOne, I can't seem to drink enough water to support my insanely grueling workouts. Two, Nvidia's (NVDA) stock price usually only goes up. Three, rival chip player AMD's (AMD) stock price usually only goes up. And four, I don't get enough sleep.\n\nHappy to say three of those constants held, well, constant in 2024.\n\nThe one that didn't? The stock price of now former highflier AMD finished the year down 17%. By comparison, Nvidia advanced 171% in 2024, Broadcom (AVGO) rose 107%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tacked on 28%.\n\nAMD was the ninth most popular stock (Nvidia was No. 1) held in retail investor portfolios last year, according to data from Vanda Research. The stock, on average, made up 2.07% of the average retail investor's portfolio, down from 3.37% at the start of 2024.\n\nAMD's stock price performance is astonishing if you ask me, given 1) the impressive earnings growth of the company; 2) top-notch innovation and execution on the chip front, which I was reminded of by AMD chair and CEO Lisa Su in a September chat; and 3) Intel (INTC) has fallen apart (more on that here from Yahoo Finance's Yasmin Khorram and Laura Bratton), allowing for more land-grab opportunities for AMD.\n\n\"It’s the view AMD is lost in the AI arms race behind Nvidia, and so far it's been disappointing,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told me.\n\nIves makes a key point about AMD at this juncture. The stock is being driven more by perception than actual fundamentals and outlook. To that end, here are three problems I am seeing right now with AMD sentiment.\n\nThe Nvidia effect: Nvidia's product pipeline — led by the new Blackwell chip now hitting markets — is viewed by the Street as being one year ahead of AMD in terms of artificial intelligence performance (something that may be on display in Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote next week). This is seen as holding back market share gain opportunities for AMD.\n\nThe cloud player effect: Major cloud players are increasingly opting for custom chips from Marvell (MRVL) and Broadcom. For example, Amazon (AMZN) has strongly indicated its preference for custom chips from its Trainium line and Marvell or for Nvidia products, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya pointed out. Separately, Google (GOOG) continues to prefer internal chips and those from Broadcom and Nvidia.\n\nWeak PC sales outlook: The outlook for the PC market in 2025 remains subdued at best, putting risk to AMD's estimates. Some on the Street have whispered the first half of 2025 could actually bring a PC market correction.\n\nAMD did little to help sentiment around its stock by guiding for fourth quarter earnings per share to be 8% below consensus when it reported earnings in late October.\n\n\"AMD's challenge (and opportunity) in calendar year 2025 will be to take share in enterprise PC where Intel is dominant, while fending off threat from ARM-based (Qualcomm) rivals,\" Arya wrote.\n\nHaving said that, the fundamentals paint a different picture of AMD — and it raises the question if the stock has gotten too cheap.\n\nThe company's new AI chip, dubbed the MI300, notched $1.5 billion in sales in the third quarter of 2024. It represented the fastest product to $1 billion in sales in a quarter ever for AMD. AMD guided to $5 billion in MI300 sales for 2024, up from $4.5 billion.\n\nThe Street thinks this number could reach about $9.5 billion in 2025.\n\nMomentum on the AI chip front has AMD on pace for at least 50% earnings growth this year, based on analyst estimates on Yahoo Finance. If the PC market doesn't drop off and AI demand stays strong, AMD's earnings growth could be well north of 70%.\n\n\"We believe AMD is being underestimated for its AI potential,\" Ives contended.\n\nLooking at the stock's valuation, investors have forgotten that type of growth potential for AMD.\n\nThe stock trades on a trailing price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio of 0.31 times, below 1 times for Nvidia and oddly below the 0.55 times afforded struggling Intel. AMD's forward price-to-earnings (PE) multiple of 24 times is also well under Nvidia's.\n\nAnd the stock is off by almost 50% from its 52-week high while competitors hover around record highs.\n\n\"We remain buyers based on our view that the company continues to gain traction as the #2 supplier of merchant accelerator solutions,\" Evercore ISI semiconductor analyst Mark Lipacis wrote. \"History shows that one ecosystem typically captures 70-80% of the value of each computing era, which we’ve argued would be Nvidia, leaving 20-30% of a rapidly growing market for AMD to prosecute as the only other merchant chip supplier. We like AMD’s strategy, which we view to be similar to its (successful) CPU strategy vs. Intel and focused on optimizing its solution for the high-volume AI workloads.\"\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

    "text": "With the start of any new presidential administration, there comes uncertainty surrounding economic policy. That is as true as ever, even with Republicans controlling both the White House and Congress.\n\nBut how does this uncertainty affect investors’ portfolios?\n\nOne Man’s Attempt to Get a Perfect 850 Credit Score\n\nAmazon’s Prime Video Acquires Melania Trump Film\n\nCenterview Partners Considers a Deal of Its Own After Record Year\n\nIn Times of Economic-Policy Uncertainty, It May Be Best to Avoid Stocks\n\nForklifts Hurt Thousands of Workers Each Year. Factories Are Seeking Alternatives.\n\nWe decided to test this question by looking back at 40 years of returns in stock and fixed-income mutual funds and comparing against the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, a measure used by the Federal Reserve that counts the number of newspaper articles containing the terms “economy,” “policy” and “uncertainty.”\n\nBroadly, stocks perform better when economic policy uncertainty falls and bonds do better when it rises. But within those tendencies, we find some segments of the market perform worse than others—particularly when uncertainty emerges, as it did around the presidential election.\n\nTo conduct our study, my research assistants (Abigia Abebe and Thomas Kang) and I first pulled mutual-fund return data across various asset classes: U.S. large-cap, U.S. growth, U.S. value, U.S. small-cap, international stocks, U.S. fixed income, short-term debt, high-yield debt, international bonds, emerging-market debt and commodities.\n\nWe then partitioned returns in these various classes by the level of uncertainty—when uncertainty is high (at the 75 th percentile or higher), and when uncertainty is low (at the 25 th percentile or lower).\n\nWere are we at this moment? Not surprisingly, high economic-policy uncertainty.\n\nOur first finding is that in general when uncertainty is high, it is a bad time to be in stocks. For instance, when uncertainty is at the 75th percentile or higher, the median monthly return for U.S. large-caps is 1.42%. When uncertainty is at the 25th percentile or lower, the median monthly return for U.S. large-caps is 1.52%. This difference of 0.10 percentage point a month might seem low, but that is a return difference of 1.2 percentage points a year.\n\nWhen we look at other riskier stock classes, we see much bigger divergence. For instance, when uncertainty is at the 75th percentile or higher, the median monthly return for U.S. small-caps is 1.52%. When uncertainty is at the 25th percentile or lower, the median monthly return is 1.83%. This yields a difference of 0.31 percentage point a month, or nearly 4 percentage points a year.\n\nNext and more relevant to our current situation as the White House changes hands, we decided to look at returns in these asset classes when policy uncertainty jumps a considerable amount or when it falls a considerable amount. Here we see even bigger differences in results.\n\nWhen uncertainty jumps (or rises by one standard deviation in a given month) the median return for U.S. large-caps is negative 2.01%. When uncertainty falls in a given month (a one standard deviation decrease) the median return for U.S. large-caps is 1.85%. This yields a difference of 3.86 percentage points a month.\n\nThese results are even more extreme for riskier stocks. When uncertainty jumps, the median return for U.S. small-caps is negative 1.95% a month. When uncertainty falls in a given month, the median return for U.S. small-caps is 3.56%. This yields a difference of 5.51 percentage points a month.\n\nTurning toward fixed-income funds, we see the opposite set of results—indicating that investors are turning to bonds as a haven when uncertainty jumps. For instance, for U.S. fixed-income funds, the median return when uncertainty spikes is 0.63% a month. When uncertainty falls, the median monthly return is 0.18%. This yields a difference of 0.45 percentage point a month.\n\nThe key takeaway: If uncertainty stays where it is now, it may be smart to avoid stocks in favor of short-term bonds. But if uncertainty decreases over the next few months, it is best to be in stocks, especially small-caps.\n\nDerek Horstmeyer is a professor of finance at Costello College of Business, George Mason University, in Fairfax, Va.

    "text": "The debate over highly skilled foreign workers is heating up.\n\nA contentious exchange over foreign workers that began during Christmas between conservative activist Laura Loomer and Elon Musk has spilled over from X, now with a prominent Democrat weighing in. The focus, though, has turned away from undocumented workers, a central theme in Donald Trump's presidential campaign last year, to those here legally on H-1B visas.\n\nCritics of the work visa program worry that these workers are displacing Americans by providing cheaper labor, especially in the tech industry, which is the largest sponsor of these visas. Supporters say there are simply not enough US workers to fill the demand needed in these growing industries and the program's rules prevent wage suppression.\n\n\"This program should not and was not intended to substitute the American talent. It was designed to supplement it and, by and large, it has been working,\" Jeanne Batalova, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBut she noted that some companies have used the program in a way that's \"not within the spirit of the law,\" which is part of what is fueling the current debate. Here's what to know.\n\nCreated in 1990 by the Immigration Act, the H-1B is a temporary, nonimmigrant visa program that allows companies to request permission to hire very skilled foreign workers with at least a bachelor's degree or equivalent. (Fashion models \"of distinguished merit and ability\" also fall under this visa category but without the education requirements, according to the US Department of Labor.)\n\nIf granted the visa, a foreign worker can initially stay in the US under the H-1B for three years, with a possible extension to six years. But some workers stay on H-1B visas for longer than that if they have an approved petition for a green card.\n\n\"We limit the number of people from any given country that can get a green card in a given year, so you can stay in H-1B status while you're waiting to make the country's quota,\" Mark Regets, a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy, said.\n\nSince the H-1B status was created, Congress has limited the number of new H-1B visas available each year. Currently, the annual cap is 65,000 new H-1B visas and an additional 20,000 for foreign professionals who graduate with a master’s degree or higher from a US university. That hasn't changed since 2006.\n\nThe biggest industry by far using H-1B visas is what's categorized as professional, scientific, and technical services, which made up almost half of all approved initial visas in fiscal year 2024. Following that were educational services at 11.9% of all approvals, manufacturing at 9.3%, and healthcare and social assistance at 6.5%.\n\nThe largest employers of H-1B visas are subsequently concentrated in the tech sector, starting with Amazon (AMZN), which had 3,871 approved H-1B petitions for new employment in fiscal year 2024, followed by Cognizant (CTSH) (2,873), Infosys (INFY) (2,504), TCS (1,452), and IBM (IBM) (1,348). Other tech behemoths like Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) are included in the top 25. Of special note, Musk's Tesla (TSLA) came in at No. 16 on the top employers for initial H-1B visa approvals at 742.\n\nNon-tech companies like Ernst & Young, Walmart (WMT), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Citibank (C) all appear in the top 25 as well, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, using data from the USCIS H-1B Employer Data Hub.\n\nOverall, more than 30,000 employers across the US had at least one H-1B visa petition approved in 2024, and over half of those new petitions went to employers that filed 20 or fewer applications. Employers in California, Texas, New York, New Jersey, and Virginia had the most approved H-1B petitions for initial employment last year.\n\nThe H-1B visa program has rules employers must follow to make sure hiring a foreign worker doesn't harm US ones. Before an employer can file a petition for a visa, it must first attest on an application certified by the Department of Labor that employing an H-1B worker won't hurt the wages or working conditions of similar US workers. An employer is also required to notify its employees that it plans to hire an H-1B worker.\n\nIn the tech field, several experts said that the growth in those industries has occurred so quickly that there are too many positions available and not enough qualified US workers to fill them. That's why tech companies turn to foreign labor to meet the demand now.\n\n\"If you're looking to grow an industry quickly, you don't necessarily have time for a whole workforce to take 10 years to get their PhD in semiconductor nanorobotics,\" said Courtney Shupert, an economist at MacroPolicy Perspectives. \"You want all of those PhDs now.\"\n\nStill, researchers at the Economic Policy Institute noted that the supply-demand imbalance for workers in the tech industry has been overstated. Other EPI research shows tech companies continue to hire H-1B workers in large numbers while shrinking their US workforces. They conclude that some tech companies are turning to cheaper foreign workers rather than hiring US workers. Other employers have brought over foreign tech workers and leased them out to other US companies, which lay off their IT departments made up of local, more expensive workers, according to EPI.\n\nWhy are H-1B workers cheaper? They aren't supposed to be. To ensure wages remain competitive, an employer must pay the H-1B worker either the same wage it gives to other employees with similar experience and qualifications for a given job or the prevailing wage for that position in the area it's located, whichever is higher.\n\nRegets said studies have found that most people with a temporary work visa in the US with a college degree or higher actually earn a bit more than a comparable US-born worker. Another study showed that native-born IT professionals earn more than other US-born professionals, indicating there's no suppression of wages due to H-1B workers in the industry.\n\nBut the EPI found that some companies, again often in the tech field, are taking advantage of how the program level-sets wages to pay H-1B workers less than what a US worker in the same position would make.\n\nBatalova noted that some companies, often in the tech sector, have exploited loopholes in the rules of the H-1B program. (Even Musk acknowledged the program \"needs major reform\" around setting minimum salaries.) Some of these issues are getting addressed, with new rules requiring that a petition is for a specific worker rather than a position, Batalova said.\n\nThese kinds of efforts should deter fraud, but \"not be so stifling that [the program] doesn't work in practice,\" she said, noting there are very real needs H-1B workers are filling. Not only is our workforce shrinking as the baby boomers retire, but the pandemic also exacerbated shortages in certain industries, such as teachers in K-12 education.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, in a release this week raising concerns about the visa program, asked: \"Can we really not find English teachers in America?\" The answer appears to be no in some school districts.\n\nThe city of Dallas has been leaning on international educators due to a shortage of bilingual teachers in the US. In 2022, the Camden City School District in New Jersey turned to foreign labor to help fill 28 open positions it couldn't find hires for after months of searching. And Milwaukee Public Schools in 2023 brought in 140 teachers from other countries, including Nigeria, Mexico and the Philippines, amid the teacher shortage.\n\nH-1B visas also allow international students graduating from US medical schools to stay in the country and work in hospitals or clinics in underserved and often remote or rural areas, Batalova said, places incidentally \"where American workers will not go.\"\n\nCorrection: The article has been corrected throughout to denote that the H-1B program is a work visa program, not an immigration program.\n\n—\n\nJanna Herron is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

    "text": "Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Investment Management, is known for actively trading tech stocks she believes will shake up industries.\n\nThis week, she stuck to her strategy of buying stocks when their prices drop.\n\n🎁 Don’t Miss This Amazing Holiday Move! Buy 1 Year and Get 1 Year FREE on TheStreet Pro. Act now before it’s gone 🎁\n\nInvestors and analysts have mixed opinions on Cathie Wood. Supporters see her as a visionary in tech investing, but critics say she’s only a mediocre fund manager.\n\nWood's followers affectionately dubbed her “Mama Cathie” after she drew widespread attention with a remarkable 153% return in 2020.\n\nRelated: 5 quantum computing stocks investors are targeting in 2025\n\nHowever, her longer-term performance isn’t so hot:\n\nThe flagship ARK Innovation ETF  (ARKK) , with $6.7 billion under management, returned 12.65% for the past 12 months, with an annualized three-year return of -15.59% and a five-year return of 2.92%.\n\nIn comparison, the S&P 500 gained 25.45% in the past year, with a three-year annualized return of 8.86% and a five-year return of 14.28%.\n\nCathie Wood’s investment strategy is straightforward: Her ARK ETFs typically buy shares in emerging, high-tech companies in fields such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, DNA sequencing, energy storage, and robotics.\n\nWood says these companies will transform industries, but their volatility causes significant swings in ARK funds' values.\n\nRelated: Cathie Wood sells $21.5 million of soaring tech stocks\n\nInvestment research firm Morningstar has sharply criticized Wood and Ark Innovation ETF.\n\nAmy Arnott, Morningstar portfolio strategist, calculated that Ark Innovation wiped $7.1 billion of shareholder wealth from its 2014 inception through 2023. That put the ETF as No. 3 on her wealth destruction list for mutual funds and ETFs for the past decade.\n\nWood recently shared optimism about a move toward fewer regulations under Donald Trump's presidency, especially in areas like technology, cryptocurrencies and digital assets.\n\n“In the last four years, we saw massive concentration toward very few stocks,” Wood said on CNN’s Inside Politics Sunday in December 2024. “I think the market’s going to broaden out right now and reward companies who are at the leading edge of innovation.”\n\nNot all investors are persuaded by Wood's confidence. Over the past year, Ark Innovation ETF saw a net outflow of $3.2 billion, with $219 million exiting the fund in the past week, according to ETF research firm VettaFi.\n\nOn Dec. 31, Wood’s Ark funds bought 82,456 shares of Advanced Micro Devices  (AMD) .\n\nThat chunk of shares was valued at roughly $9.94 million as of Jan. 2’s close.\n\nIn October 2024 AMD posted third-quarter earnings that matched analysts' estimates, with revenue coming in slightly ahead of expectations.\n\nIts fourth-quarter revenue outlook fell short of Wall Street's forecasts. The company projected sales of $7.5 billion, compared with the anticipated $7.55 billion.\n\nRelated: Analysts reveal top AI stocks for 2025, including Nvidia and Palantir\n\nAI still dominates the AMD story, but the company's AI market share remained significantly lower than that of its competitor, Nvidia, which dominated the AI GPU market.\n\nAMD also faces challenges in meeting the growing demand for its AI processors, with CEO Lisa Su indicating that chip supplies would be tight going into the next year.\n\n\"And going into the next few quarters going into 2025, I think we expect that the environment will continue to be tight, but we've also planned for significant growth going into 2025. And so we feel good about our overall supply chain capability,\" Su said in the company's Q3 earnings call.\n\n\"The concern from here is that AMD won't be able to provide upside to [Wall Street] estimates that are already $8 billion-$9 billion for calendar 2025,\" Jefferies analysts said, according to Reuters.\n\nShares of AMD dropped about 10% over the past year as the company faces challenges meeting investors' high hopes. This follows a sharp rally in 2023 when the shares doubled due to excitement around AI-related growth.\n\nMore stocks’ performance in 2024\n\nThe 5 best performing stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2024\n\nThe 5 worst-performing stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2024\n\nThe 5 best performing stocks on the Nasdaq 100 in 2024\n\nThe 5 worst performing stocks on the Nasdaq 100 in 2024\n\nThe 5 best performing stocks on the S&P 500 in 2024\n\nThe 5 worst performing stocks on the S&P 500 in 2024\n\nIn November 2024, AMD announced a reduction in its global workforce of 1,000, or 4%, of its employees.\n\nAMD is not in Ark Innovation's  (ARKK)  top 10 holdings as of Jan. 2.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager delivers alarming S&P 500 forecast",

The holidays have reduced energy levels.\n\nSo, it takes a little while for the Street machinery to build back up.\n\n🎁 Buy 1 Year and Get 1 Year FREE on TheStreet Pro. Act now before it's gone ⏰\n\nNot in 2025.  The first week will be packed with market-moving events and reports, including:\n\nRelated: 2024 domestic box office falls to $8.7 billion for first time since COVID-19\n\nThe Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas (running basically all week).\n\nMinutes from the Federal Reserve meeting in December.\n\nThe big December jobs report.\n\nThe start of the fourth-quarter 2024 earnings season.\n\nAll of this in the context of two realities:\n\nStocks had a great 2024 but sagged a bit in December as interest rates climbed.\n\nThe inauguration of Donald Trump for a second presidential term is coming in three weeks, and what policies he will implement are still not clear.\n\nFirst up: Jensen Huang at the Consumer Electronics Show\n\nThe founder and CEO of  (NVDA) , the chipmaker most identified with artificial intelligence, will be Monday's keynote speaker at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.\n\nRelated: Analysts make Nvidia, AMD predictions ahead of Consumer Electronics Show\n\nThis is techland's big trade show, where companies showcase their latest products and offer hints of what's to come. About 130,000 people and 3,500 exhibitors will attend.\n\nHuang will speak at 6:20 p.m. PT Monday at the Mandalay Bay Arena. He is expected to unveil a new super-fast graphics card that gamers and others have been waiting for and updates on the shipping schedules of the Blackwell family of graphic processing units. These are the products developers of artificial intelligence applications, including large language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, have been salivating for.\n\nHuang will speak not as an all-conquering hero but as one whose company's shares soared 239% in 2023 but then had to weather a volatile 2024.\n\nNvidia was twice the world's most valuable company. The shares rose 173% between the end of 2023 and June 18. They fell 27.5% between June 18 and Aug. 7. And rallied 35.8% between Aug. 7 and Dec. 31.\n\nFor all that, the shares ended up 171.2% for the year — where they were in June.\n\nIn the two days since New Year's, Nvidia's stock price jumped an additional 7.6%.\n\nThe CES conference officially starts on Tuesday and ends on Friday. One of the presentations many are looking for highlights laptops using Microsoft  (MSFT)  Windows and CoPilot, Microsoft's AI program.  Manufacturers including Lenovo, HP, Dell, Samsung, Acer, and Asus are working on new machines.\n\nThe Labor Department's jobs report is normally the first Friday of the month. The 2024 holiday calendar forced a week's delay.\n\nThe consensus is that the report will show 153,000 new jobs created in December 2024, with the unemployment rate holding at 4.2%, the same level as November. Look for the revisions on the most recent report, which said 227,000 jobs were created in November.\n\nThe jobs situation has moderated since June because many companies haven't needed to add staff. A bigger issue is that many companies, especially restaurants, bars, and other retail stores, have been cutting staff.\n\nIn addition, many jobs are dependent on a healthier real estate market. But rates on 30-year mortgages have been holding steadily at or just below 7%, the highest levels since July, despite recent Fed interest rate cuts.\n\nIf you're trying to predict where interest rates might be headed, the minutes of the Federal Reserve's December 17-18 meeting will provide some hints. They will be released Wednesday at 2 p.m.\n\nAt the December meeting, the Fed cut its key interest rate a quarter point to 4.25% to 4.5%, but Chairman Jerome Powell cautioned against thinking the central bank will be cutting rates rapidly in 2025.\n\nIndeed, bond markets have been balking at pushing rates lower. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has risen from 3.623% before the Fed's September meeting to 4.602% as of Friday.\n\nThe problem is the continued stickiness of inflation. No one can say exactly what the problem is except shelter costs aren't falling and food prices are getting hit by odd things like bird flu. Bond investors are worried about U.S. government finances and the huge borrowings needed to keep the government operating.\n\nThe inflation stickiness has pushed the rates on 30-year mortgages to just about 7% from about 6.1% in early September.\n\nThe rate increase adds about $165 a month — nearly 11% — to the principal-and-interest payment on a $250,000 mortgage.\n\nAnyone looking to buy or sell a home is painfully aware of the dilemma. If inflation erupts in 2025, the pain will be worse.\n\nThe week will be disrupted on Thursday when stock markets and markets that trade stock derivatives close for former President Jimmy Carter's funeral.\n\nThe markets for Treasury securities will be open for just a half day. Futures markets that are not tied to stocks will operate as usual.\n\nThe earnings season starts this week and will pick up rapidly as January progresses.\n\nThis week's reports include second-quarter results on Tuesday from Cal-Maine Foods  (CALM) , the nation's largest commercial producer of eggs. Analysts will want to know what problems the latest bird-flu outbreak has caused for the Mississippi-based company company.\n\nEgg supplies nationally are tight, and prices have been rising. Cal-Maine's commercial egg-producing farms have been able to meet demand and enjoy higher prices. Shares jumped 79.3% in 2024 and 4.5% on Thursday and Friday.\n\nDelta Air Lines  (DAL)  reports on Friday morning. The big airline shares were up 50% in 2024. The company has been able to capitalize on increasing business travel demand and, as important, increasing demand from high-income consumers. It has reinstated its dividend and has a fully-funded pension plan. It expects to report $5 billion in free cash flow this year.\n\nAlso reporting this week:\n\nWednesday: Albertsons  (ACI) , the big supermarket chain whose deal to merge with Kroger  (KR)  was blocked in courts.

But it was a surprise.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped 2.5% for the month, a touch more in the first two days of January. The Dow Jones industrials dropped 5.3% on the month.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite posted a 0.5% gain for December, but after hitting an all-time intraday high of 20,205 on December 16, it slid below 20,000 by December 31.\n\nLuckily, the averages all moved higher on Friday, though not enough to make the week positive.\n\nWhat comes next is the waiting for Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20.\n\nPlus, there is so much riding on the expansion of artificial intelligence applications and how they might profoundly boost productivity and economic output.\n\nMore 2025 stock market forecasts\n\nVeteran analyst who predicted the S&P 500's rally unveils target for 2025\n\nAnalysts rework interest rate cut forecasts for 2025\n\nVeteran trader who correctly picked Palantir as top stock in 2024 reveals best stock for 2025\n\nWhile Wall Street players are optimistic about January and beyond because of Trump's vows to cut regulation and taxes and the prospect of lower interest rates, there is a sense individual investors are not quite as bullish.\n\nThe American Association of Individual Investors' weekly survey of expectations shows overall bullishness sliding to 35.4% in the most recent week from 49.8% on Nov. 13 and a high for the year of 52.7% in mid-July. Bearishness has risen to 34.2% from 27.6% on Nov. 6.\n\nThe survey, released weekly since 1987, asks respondents if they're bullish, neutral, or negative on stocks for the next six months.\n\nIt's debatable whether individuals can affect markets that much anymore. Today, much of stock trading is dominated by large institutions and passive investing—mutual funds, hedge funds, and exchange-traded funds.\n\nPlus, AAII peak bullish or bearish levels often signal a market turn. Right now, the AAII levels aren't extreme.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager issues dire S&P 500 warning for 2025",

    "text": "Listen and subscribe to Decoding Retirement on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nAcross the US, family members caring for loved ones provide an estimated $600 billion in unpaid care each year, sacrificing time, money, and often their well-being to care for aging loved ones, according to an AARP survey.\n\nAnd the need for caregivers “is about to skyrocket,” Surya Kolluri, the head of the TIAA Institute, said in a recent Decoding Retirement podcast (see video above or listen below).\n\nIt’s high time that individuals, families, and employers start addressing the issues associated with unpaid caregiving, Kolluri said, and he outlined some of the statistics to make his case.\n\nSince 2011, some 10,000 baby boomers have been turning 65 every day, and that number is on the rise, he said. In fact, 2024 marked the beginning of what’s been described as \"Peak 65,\" the largest surge of Americans turning 65 in US history. Over 4.1 million Americans will turn 65 each year through 2027, which is more than 11,200 every day.\n\nWhat’s more, baby boomers are living longer than previous generations. According to Kolluri, life expectancy at birth has increased by about 17 years since Social Security's inception.\n\nAt the same time, he noted, 1 in 5 adults provide uncompensated care and spend an average of $7,200 per year on costs associated with such care.\n\nCaregivers, in general, have lower financial assets and higher levels of debt compared to those who don't care for loved ones. In fact, 1 in 4 of those caregivers have less than $1,000 in savings and investments. For non-caregivers, the number is close to 1 in 7.\n\nTo make matters worse, Kolluri pointed out that caregivers typically devote an average of 24 hours per week to unpaid care, and 60% of them also juggle jobs outside the home.\n\nIf you’re managing your job and caregiving responsibilities, there’s a price to be paid.\n\n“We find that 61% of those caregivers reported at least one work-related consequence,” Kolluri said. “What do I mean by that? Arriving late, leaving early, taking time off, or, as we saw during the pandemic, retiring sooner than planned.”\n\nThere’s an even steeper cost for women and millennials (those generally born between 1981 and 1996). In TIAA’s research, 60% of caregivers are women and 25% of caregivers are in their 20s or 30s.\n\n“Becoming a caregiver ... at an early age has heightened implications because people in this age group might not be in their peak earning capacity,” Kolluri said. “They might have lower salaries and should be focusing on taking strides in their careers. Now they have this other responsibility.”\n\nPlus, those millennials might also be raising children. “And this creates even more emotional and financial burdens on them,” Kolluri said.\n\nKolluri highlighted strategies that can help families avoid the negative impacts of unpaid caregiving.\n\nIn most cases, Kolluri said it’s a crisis — a \"hair-on-fire moment\" — that triggers the need for unpaid caregiving. But if you have a plan in place to address caregiving responsibilities, \"you can put out that fire quicker,\" he said.\n\n“I think it's very important for individuals and families to include this topic of caregiving in financial planning,” Kolluri said.\n\nTo be sure, these discussions aren’t always easy. Kolluri shared his personal experience of caring for his 88-year-old father.\n\n“That dialogue was not easy,” he said. “I may be an expert in caregiving, but when it comes to having that actual conversation with your parent, it’s difficult. … It’s been a three-year journey for me.\"\n\n\n\nEmployers can also play a crucial role by offering benefits such as flex time, paid family leave, and geriatric care management. Kolluri emphasized the importance of training frontline managers to ensure they can effectively provide and communicate these resources to their staff.\n\n“It can be a productivity loss if a peak performer at the company goes into this caregiving responsibility,” Kolluri said. So those benefits can “really help alleviate an employee's stress around this.”\n\nLastly, Kolluri said tools such as the Caregiver Intensity Index can help those already providing caregiving services assess how caregiving affects their well-being and how they're coping with financial stressors and other stressors.\n\nEach Tuesday, retirement expert and financial educator Robert Powell gives you the tools to plan for your future on Decoding Retirement.

    "text": "While artificial intelligence (AI) advancements primarily dominated news cycles over the past year, veteran hedge fund manager David Kass predicts AI will soon be replaced by quantum computing as the new hot technology innovation.\n\n💰💸 Don’t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet’s FREE Daily newsletter 💰💸\n\nQuantum computing is quickly advancing at the front of a fast-growing frontier of technology, and tech companies are starting to recognize its potential to accelerate computational power, further changing how we live and work.\n\nA highly advanced type of computing based upon the principles of quantum mechanics, quantum computing could spark the next tech sector gold rush for investors in 2025.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager issues dire S&P 500 warning for 2025\n\nQuantum computing can significantly enhance AI capabilities thanks to faster data processing that improves machine learning algorithms. As a result, many companies are investing in quantum computing, but there are likely to be winners and losers.\n\nQuantum computing is a highly advanced form of computing in which tasks are performed at a much faster rate. A standard computer typically works one step at a time, while a quantum system can perform multiple tasks at once.\n\n\"These systems utilize quantum bits (qubits) of information to solve complex problems at significantly higher speeds than traditional computers, doing so by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics,\" reports TheStreet.\n\nAs companies double down on large language models (LLMs) to continue AI innovations, the need for advanced computational power is increasing.\n\nCompanies in the quantum computing space may be the ones to fill this demand. And as some experts see it, this means high growth potential for a few quantum computing stocks.\n\nNo. 1: Quantum ComputingThe company has the same name as its field and has enjoyed an outstanding year. Quantum Computing  (QUBT)  stock gained almost 2,000% in 2024, rising from less than $1 per share to more than $18 in only a few months.\n\nRelated: Analysts make Nvidia, AMD predictions ahead of Consumer Electronics Show\n\nStephen Guilfoyle is a veteran Wall Street trader whose career began on the New York Stock Exchange floor in the 1980s.\n\nIn a post for TheStreet Pro, Guilfoyle revealed he owns QUBT stock. On December 24, he highlighted the company’s growth potential, stating, “Quantum Computing (QUBT) is expected to grow revenue 167% for the current quarter, 40% for the full year, and 200% next year.”\n\nIn November 2024, Guilfoyle noted that he had been trading QUBT because of its positive price action, highlighting that the sector could be poised to take off.  He acknowledges that the stock remains a purely speculative play but sees growth potential for the sector accelerating. Overall, he thinks the industry \"is going to be a 2026 or 2027 story.\"\n\nWhile that may be true, the company isn't currently profitable, and there's no telling when it might be.\n\nQuantum Computing's most recent quarterly earnings report revealed a loss-per-share of six cents on revenue of less than $200,000. In 2025, it's only expected to generate revenue of $1.5 million, yet its market cap is $2.25 billion following its meteoric run-up.\n\nNo. 2: D-Wave Quantum SystemsD-Wave Quantum Systems  (QBTS)  may not be as well known as some of its peers, but like QUBT, its shares have soared this year, rising more than 1,000%, including gains of almost 750% over the past two quarters.\n\nRelated: Analysts revamp IonQ, Rigetti, and D-Wave Quantum stock price targets on quantum computing outlook\n\nWhile the stock trades below $10 per share, bullish sentiment from Wall Street has risen. For example, Benchmark recently raised its price target to $8 from $3. QBTS has already surpassed that target.\n\nTheStreet’s Rob Lenihan reports that “Benchmark said it believes the company's recent balance sheet recapitalization, a decision that companies often make to stabilize their capital structure, \"eliminates much of the risk discount that has remained an overhang since its public debut\" following a meeting with D-Wave's CFO, John Markovich, during Benchmark's Discovery Conference.\n\nSince it made the decision to recapitalize in 2022 through a business combination with DPCM Capital, D-Wave has raised $75 million in additional capital through an at-the-market (ATM) equity offering. It also reported a 41% year-over-year (YOY) increase for QCaaS (Quantum Computing as a Service) revenue for Q3, 2024, while fiscal revenue for the year increased 11%.\n\nLike rival Quantum Computing, it's losing money. Last quarter, its loss-per-share was 9 cents.\n\nAnalysts remain bullish on QBTS stock for 2025, though, predicting revenue of $15.07 million, a 64% increase from last year.\n\nRelated: Elon Musk just got the best Christmas gift he could ask for\n\nFour other Wall Street firms currently maintain a Buy rating for D-Wave with no Holds or Sells.\n\nIts market cap has swelled to $2.47 billion, giving D-Wave a price-to-sales ratio of 168.\n\nNo. 3: IonQ, Inc.A noted quantum computing hardware and software producer, IonQ  (IONQ)  hasn’t surged by as much as Quantum Computing or D-Wave. However, shares are still up 250% for the year, and experts remain bullish on its growth prospects.\n\nDA Davidson recently initiated a Buy rating for IONQ and set a bullish $50 price target.\n\nLenihan notes that DA Davidson \"believes IonQ represents \"a compelling pure-play investment positioned to capitalize on quantum computing's rapid growth,\" driven by the increasing inadequacy of classical computing for solving complex problems.\n\nAs its name implies, IonQ's work centers around trapped ion technology, in which ionized atoms perform quantum computations. These atoms have gained or lost electrons, leading to a net electrical charge.\n\nExperts have described IonQ's core technology as highly scalable, noting its ability to perform the increasingly complex calculations that leading tech companies require. Additionally, it allows businesses and researchers to access quantum resources more easily, possibly granting it an edge over competitors.\n\nMore Tech Stocks:\n\nOngoing problem may be costing Nvidia customers\n\nTesla financial history exposes Elon Musk hypocrisy\n\nBroadcom CEO sounds alarm on crucial shift in AI-chip market\n\nOver the past quarter, Wall Street has given IonQ 4 Buy ratings and 1 Hold rating. The company reported $12.4 million in revenue for Q3 2024, which works out to 102% year-over-year growth. Analysts predict that 2025 revenue will reach $84.75 million, a gain of nearly 100%.\n\nThis company's list of partnerships with clients includes Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the United States Air Force Research Lab. The company recently announced a partnership with engineering firm Ansys  (ANSS)  to bring quantum computing to the $10 billion computer-aided engineering (CAE) market.\n\nLast quarter, IonQ lost 12 cents per share. Its market cap is $10.3 billion, giving it a price-to-sales ratio of 267.\n\nNo. 1: Rigetti ComputingAnother member of the 1,000% return club in 2024 is Rigetti Computing  (RGTI.)\n\nRigetti Computing's stock price is up almost 1,900% in the past year. It develops quantum integrated circuits, a key component for quantum computers, which may prove to be a highly lucrative niche.\n\nAdditionally, its technology combines the elements of quantum and classical computing and can offer easy integration with a client's current technology infrastructure.\n\nIn December, Craig-Hallum issued a Buy rating for Rigetti and set a $12 price target, which the stock has already exceeded. It now trades at more than $19 per share after surging more than 564% in the past month.\n\nOther Wall Street banks remain highly bullish on RGTI. It has six Buy ratings for the past quarter, with no Holds or Sells. The company reported revenue of $2.38 million, which brought its revenue for the year to $11.89 million, a decrease of 19%.\n\nAdditionally, Rigetti's balance sheet shows $22.49 in debt and only $20.29 in cash and equivalents.\n\nNo. 2: Alphabet Google's parent company isn’t regarded purely as a quantum computing stock. But Alphabet  (GOOGL)  made a significant advancement this year with Willow, its “state-of-the-art quantum computing chip,” which stands to significantly impact multiple areas of technology through its advanced computational power.\n\nRelated: Google innovation could solve big problem, create huge market\n\nAs TheStreet’s David Dierking notes,” If this chip becomes practical and stable at any point in the near future, we could be looking at huge advances in everything from medicine to scientific research to mathematics to exploration.\"\n\nDierking highlights the Defiance Quantum ETF ( (QTUM) ) as an excellent way to play the quantum market following Google’s Willow progress.\n\nGoogle is still considered a Strong Buy on Wall Street, not just because of its quantum computing exposure. It's also a major player in AI thanks to its large-language model, Gemini, and a Goliath in search and entertainment. Twenty-five analysts currently rate it as a Buy, while only six maintain Hold ratings.\n\nThe share prices of these quantum computing stocks have surged over the past year, so it's important to exercise some caution.\n\nQuantum Computing Inc., founded in 2018, is still in a fairly early stage of development. D-Wave only began trading on the stock exchange in 2022. These companies show little revenue and are still losing money.\n\nAs such, traditional valuation metrics may not apply to them as they do for larger, more established stocks, making these stocks difficult to assess properly.\n\nTech stocks often trade at a price-to-sales range of 10 to 20 and are often seen as bargains when their P/E ratios are either near 5-year lows or below 20. These stocks boast ratios much higher than that.\n\n\"I think I have identified Quantum Computing as a stronger play than D-Wave and therefore have more exposure there, but we really do not know who the winners will be,\" Guilfoyle notes.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager issues dire S&P 500 warning for 2025",

    "text": "Nicolas Economou / NurPhoto / Getty Images\n\n\n\nDelta Air Lines is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings before the opening bell on Friday.\n\nAll 13 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha rate Delta's stock as a \"buy,\" with an average price target predicting gains of 30%.\n\nDelta's revenue and adjusted net income are each expected to have risen year-over-year.\n\n\n\nDelta Air Lines (DAL) is set to report earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 before markets open Friday, with analysts expecting increases in revenue and adjusted profit.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on the airline, with all 13 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha maintaining a \"buy\" rating on Delta stock. The analysts have an average price target of $76.85 for the stock, which would be a gain of 30% from its closing level of $59 Friday.\n\nThe airline is projected to report $14.87 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, up about 4.6% from the same time last year. Net income, however, is expected to decline 45% to $1.12 billion from $2.04 billion a year earlier.\n\nDelta's fourth-quarter 2023 net income was boosted by a positive adjustment to the value of the carrier's investments, as its stake in the Wheels Up (UP) private air travel service became more valuable thanks to an jump in the company's share price in that quarter. After accounting for the value change, Delta's adjusted net income came in at $826 million a year ago, and is expected to have risen to $1.15 billion.\n\nAt the airline's investor day in November, Delta said rising demand for travel across generational lines made the company confident that it will continue to see revenue growth for its premium seating products.\n\nDelta said it expects revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to rise in the coming years as its premium products expand and its profit margins improve.\n\nThe airline is also still in the midst of its legal fight with CrowdStrike (CRWD) after filing a lawsuit late last year seeking damages for last summer's Windows outage caused by a CrowdStrike update that led to thousands of Delta flights being canceled and $500 million in costs. CrowdStrike has said it is not responsible for Delta's handling of the outage, and has sought the dismissal of the lawsuit by citing a liability and damages cap clause in their contract, CNBC reported last month.\n\nThe airline's stock has risen nearly 50% over the past 12 months.\n\nRead the original article on Investopedia",

    "text": "A version of this story first appeared on TKer.co\n\nOne of the biggest questions among market participants is how many times the Federal Reserve will cut rates in 2025. Some have even floated the possibility of a rate hike during the year.\n\nThe Fed and its decisions on monetary policy are important. Central bank actions affect the cost and availability of money, which can move the needle on the economy.\n\nBut as I’ve been arguing over the past year, the Fed is far less relevant today than it would be during economic crises that demand sudden and significant changes to policy to address problems like surging inflation, plummeting economic activity, and shortages of market liquidity.\n\nThe economy, while cooling, continues to grow. And inflation, while slightly above the Fed’s target, is anything but a crisis.\n\nIn the wake of arguably hawkish monetary policy news in December, there’s some concern out there that fewer-than-expected rate cuts from the Fed is bearish for stocks.\n\nBut for stock market investors, this narrow focus on rate cuts is misguided. How many times the Fed cuts rates is not the right question.\n\nRather, what matters are the developments in the economy that are causing the Fed to adjust its outlook for monetary policy.\n\nIn its most recent Summary of Economic Projections released in December, the central bank raised its estimates for GDP growth in 2024 and 2025 while lowering its estimates for the unemployment rate in each of those years. Those projections also came with an upward revision to inflation forecasts and a downward revision to rate cut forecasts.\n\nMaybe the better-than-expected economy is the reason why inflation is slightly above target and rate cut expectations continue to be rolled back. Is that a terrible combination of factors?\n\nThe stock market doesn’t seem to think so.\n\nDespite a little volatility in recent months, the stock market has been holding up well with the S&P 500 mostly trending higher.\n\nThis comes despite what’s arguably been an increasingly hawkish outlook for monetary policy.\n\n\"Financial markets have sharply reduced their expectations for US monetary policy easing,\" Goldman Sachs’ Jan Hatzius observed in a Dec. 23 note to clients. \"Fed funds futures now imply 2025 rate cuts totaling less than 40bp, down from 125bp right after the 50bp cut in September.\"\n\nA popular view is that rate cuts would be bullish for risk assets like stocks. So any developments that lower the odds of a rate cut in the near term would therefore be bearish. All other things being equal, this view makes sense.\n\nBut the world is complicated, and all other things are never equal.\n\nThe Fed’s decisions on monetary policy — as well as the market’s expectations for those decisions — do not occur in a vacuum. They occur in the context of everything happening in the economy.\n\nThe economy has been exceeding expectations. And better-than-expected economic results help explain better-than-expected earnings growth, and earnings are the most important driver of stock prices. These indicators are not bearish.\n\nWe had a very similar discussion a year ago in the Jan. 28 TKer: \"Whether or not the Fed cuts rates is not the right question\"\n\nAt the end of 2023, the markets were convinced the Fed would make its first rate cut of the cycle in March 2024. However, those odds tumbled as the economic data rolling in far exceeded expectations.\n\nHere’s what I said to Investopedia’s Caleb Silver at the time:\n\n… As far as whether or not they actually pivot and begin to cut or hold or whatever, I think that's really not the right question. The question [should] be, \"If they don't cut, then why are they not cutting as they suggested in their dot plots?\" Right? Is it possible that the economy heats up more than they initially modeled? Yeah, maybe that's a good reason to not cut because they're concerned that inflation is going to be bubbling up again.\n\nFrom an investor perspective and from an economic perspective, that's not exactly the worst thing in the world that the economy isn't falling apart. Because remember, a lot of these assumptions when it comes to the Fed pivot, in addition to inflation cooling, are also tied to the idea that the economy is also cooling — that growth is slowing and decelerating and that a lot of people have recessions on their mind. So maybe the Fed doesn't pivot because the economy's picking up. That's really not that big a deal.\n\nAs we now know, that initial rate cut got pushed back all the way to September.\n\nImportantly, the stock market continued to trend higher during this period.\n\nAs much as everyone wants to avoid economic crises, history suggests they’re unavoidable. So there may eventually come a time when Fed policy decisions have a more significant impact on the outlook for markets.\n\nBut for now, monetary policy is just one of many things that can move markets.\n\n\"For U.S. equity returns, policy moves take a backseat to the scarcity or abundance of corporate profits,\" BofA’s Savita Subramanian said in September.\n\nThis speaks to TKer Stock Market Truth No. 5: \"News about the economy or policy moves markets to the degree they are expected to impact earnings. Earnings (a.k.a. profits) are why you invest in companies.\"\n\nAnd currently, the outlook for earnings growth remains favorable.\n\nThere were several notable data points and macroeconomic developments since our last review:\n\nUnemployment claims fall. Initial claims for unemployment benefits fell to 211,000 during the week ending December 28, down from 222,000 the week prior. This metric continues to be at levels historically associated with economic growth.\n\nConsumer vibes deteriorate. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index ticked lower in December. From the firm’s Dana Peterson: \"While weaker consumer assessments of the present situation and expectations contributed to the decline, the expectations component saw the sharpest drop. Consumer views of current labor market conditions continued to improve, consistent with recent jobs and unemployment data, but their assessment of business conditions weakened. Compared to last month, consumers in December were substantially less optimistic about future business conditions and incomes. Moreover, pessimism about future employment prospects returned after cautious optimism prevailed in October and November.\"\n\nConsumers feel better about the labor market. From The Conference Board’s December Consumer Confidence survey: \"Consumers’ appraisals of the labor market improved in December. 37.0% of consumers said jobs were ‘plentiful,’ up from 33.6% in November. 14.8% of consumers said jobs were ‘hard to get,’ down from 15.2%.\"\n\nMany economists monitor the spread between these two percentages (a.k.a., the labor market differential), and it’s been reflecting a cooling labor market.\n\nCard spending data is holding up. From JPMorgan: \"As of 21 Dec 2024, our Chase Consumer Card spending data (unadjusted) was 2.1% above the same day last year. Based on the Chase Consumer Card data through 21 Dec 2024, our estimate of the US Census December control measure of retail sales m/m is 0.82%.\"\n\nMortgage rates tick higher. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.91%, up from 6.85% last week. From Freddie Mac: \"Inching up to just shy of seven percent, mortgage rates reached their highest point in nearly six months. Compared to this time last year, rates are elevated and the market’s affordability headwinds persist. However, buyers appear to be more inclined to get off the sidelines as pending home sales rise.\"\n\nThere are 147 million housing units in the U.S., of which 86.6 million are owner-occupied and 34 million (or 40%) of which are mortgage-free. Of those carrying mortgage debt, almost all have fixed-rate mortgages, and most of those mortgages have rates that were locked in before rates surged from 2021 lows. All of this is to say: Most homeowners are not particularly sensitive to movements in home prices or mortgage rates.\n\nHome prices rise. According to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index, home prices rose 0.3% month-over-month in October. From S&P Dow Jones Indices’ Brian Luke: \"Our National Index hit its 17th consecutive all-time high, and only two markets – Tampa and Cleveland – fell during the past month. The annual returns continue to post positive inflation-adjusted returns but are falling well short of the annualized gains experienced this decade. Markets in Florida and Arizona are rising, but not keeping up with inflation, and are well off the over 10% gains annually from 2020 to present. This has allowed other markets to catch up.\"\n\nNew home sales rise. Sales of newly built homes jumped 5.9% in November to an annualized rate of 664,000 units.\n\nConstruction spending ticks higher. Construction spending increased modestly to an annual rate of $2.15 trillion in November.\n\nManufacturing surveys could be better. From S&P Global’s December U.S. Manufacturing PMI: \"US factories reported a tough end to 2024, and have scaled back their optimism for growth in the year ahead. Production was cut at an increased rate in December amid disappointing inflows of new orders. While November had seen a near-stabilization of order books as uncertainty surrounding the election passed, reviving customer demand, this respite has proved temporary. Factories are reporting an environment of subdued sales and inquiries, notably in terms of exports. Many firms are generally anticipating that business will pick up in the New Year, with respondents pinning hopes on expectations that the new administration will loosen regulations, reduce tax burdens and boost demand for US-made goods via tariffs.\"\n\nThe ISM Manufacturing PMI improved in December but continued to signal contraction in the sector.\n\nKeep in mind that during times of perceived stress, soft survey data tends to be more exaggerated than actual hard data.\n\nMost U.S. states are still growing. From the Philly Fed’s November State Coincident Indexes report: \"Over the past three months, the indexes increased in 39 states, decreased in 10 states, and remained stable in one, for a three-month diffusion index of 58. Additionally, in the past month, the indexes increased in 31 states, decreased in 15 states, and remained stable in four, for a one-month diffusion index of 32.\"\n\nNear-term GDP growth estimates remain positive. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model sees real GDP growth climbing at a 2.4% rate in Q4.\n\nThe long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth. And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.\n\nDemand for goods and services is positive, and the economy continues to grow. At the same time, economic growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less \"coiled\" these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings have faded.\n\nTo be clear: The economy remains very healthy, supported by strong consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation remains positive. And the Federal Reserve — having resolved the inflation crisis — has shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market.\n\nWe are in an odd period given that the hard economic data has decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continue to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor’s perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up.\n\nAnalysts expect the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy, thanks largely due to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have adjusted their cost structures aggressively. This has come with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth — in the cooling economy — is translating to robust earnings growth.\n\nOf course, this does not mean we should get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about — such as U.S. political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, cyber attacks, etc. There are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets.\n\nThere’s also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect to experience as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened.\n\nFor now, there’s no reason to believe there’ll be a challenge that the economy and the markets won’t be able to overcome over time. The long game remains undefeated, and it’s a streak long-term investors can expect to continue.\n\nA version of this story first appeared on TKer.co",

    "text": "Listen and subscribe to Decoding Retirement on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTalking about money with one’s parents isn't usually an appealing encounter — but as more millennials and Gen Zers find themselves with aging parents, these discussions are becoming increasingly important.\n\n“The talk” about an aging parent’s finances and end-of-life plans can be the key to ensuring long-term generational wealth — especially since most wealth doesn’t last longer than three generations, according to Dr. Lazetta Braxton, founder of Lazetta & Associates and the Real Wealth Coterie.\n\n“When you don't have the benefit of having substantial wealth that is taking care of multiple generations … you have to disclose about where everybody is, because if you don't know, then the risk of the unknown can be catastrophic,” Braxton explained on Yahoo Finance’s Decoding Retirement podcast (see video above or listen below).\n\nFinancial discussions have long been considered taboo, especially for older generations. That's why younger generations often find themselves responsible for initiating these sensitive conversations.\n\nInstead of approaching \"the talk\" as one tell-all discussion, Braxton encouraged people to think about it as a “series of conversations.”\n\n\"It's not interrogating a parent,\" Braxton said. \"It's giving them the opportunity to be proud of what they've done, even if they haven't done all the things they really had desired to along the way.\"\n\nFor starters, she recommended that younger generations consider how uplifting the environment is before initiating a conversation with their parents.\n\nOften, details about an elder’s power of attorney for healthcare and assets aren’t discussed until a major life event or crisis occurs, which can make financial discussions strenuous.\n\nInstead, it’s best to start these conversations with lower stakes, Braxton said. She warned that approaching the discussion during a high-stress time “could reset the conversation for decades.”\n\nIt also may be helpful to have a third party, such as a financial planner, present when discussing more gritty details, as they can provide the facts and act as a neutral player in the conversation, Braxton said. Having a professional be a part of some of these conversations can also help define and outline some of the more confusing terms a person may not know going into the conversation.\n\n\n\n“It's so important in terms of building relationships ... [to] know the trigger points and the glimmer points,” Braxton explained. “The trigger points ... [shut] a family member down and the glimmer points ... [give] them comfort and trust to say it is safe to talk about these conversations.”\n\nDeveloping the trust with an aging parent to discuss these hard topics may take some time — even with a third party providing neutral facts and detailed definitions — but putting the conversations off is counterproductive, Braxton said.\n\nShe cautioned the importance of discussing finances before conditions such as dementia set in, \"since then it's too late to have those conversations.\"\n\n“Vulnerability is a good thing,” Braxton said. “Someone has to start it, right? It doesn't have to be an expert, it just has to be someone with courage.”\n\nEach Tuesday, retirement expert and financial educator Robert Powell gives you the tools to plan for your future on Decoding Retirement.

    "text": "Warren Buffett paid tribute to Charlie Munger and pared his Apple and Bank of America bets in 2024.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway hit a $1 trillion market value, and its cash pile ballooned to more than $300 billion.\n\nBuffett donated some $6 billion to good causes and updated his plan for postmortem giving.\n\nWarren Buffett had a year to remember in 2024 as he sold two of his favorite stocks, built his cash pile to more than $300 billion, and led Berkshire Hathaway to a $1 trillion market value for the first time.\n\nThe 94-year-old Berkshire CEO and legendary investor also paid credit to his late right-hand man, gifted more than $6 billion to good causes, and updated his plan to give away his fortune following his death.\n\n1. Paying respects\n\nIn his annual letter in February, Buffett paid tribute to Charlie Munger, his business partner and Berkshire's vice chairman for more than four decades, who died age 99 in November 2023.\n\n\"Though I have long been in charge of the construction crew; Charlie should forever be credited with being the architect,\" Buffett wrote, calling himself the \"general contractor\" who carried out Munger's vision for Berkshire.\n\nBuffett also dashed hopes for a transformative acquisition anytime soon. Berkshire's vast scale means only a few companies in the country could move the needle, he said, and all of them have been \"endlessly picked over by us and others.\"\n\n\"All in all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance.\"\n\nThe investor also called out a rise in \"casino-like behavior\" in markets and appeared to take aim at trading apps such as Robinhood once again. \"The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants.\"\n\n2. Pilgrimage to Omaha\n\nTens of thousands of Berkshire shareholders descended on Buffett's hometown in May to attend the company's annual meeting and watch the \"Oracle of Omaha\" hold court for several hours.\n\nBuffett told the crowd he'd sold a chunk of his massive Apple stake in the first quarter. He also compared artificial intelligence to nuclear weapons and took responsibility for a losing wager on Paramount.\n\nThe Berkshire boss said he regretted not listening to Munger and betting big on Costco decades ago. He also raised the alarm on the national debt and budget deficit, dismissed foreign threats to the dollar, and said he could earn a 50% annual return on $1 million.\n\n3. Stocks, cash, and buybacks\n\nBuffett and his team sold $133 billion of stocks in the first nine months of 2024 and bought less than $6 billion worth. In comparison, they sold a net $24 billion of stocks in 2023 and purchased a net $34 billion of stocks in 2022.\n\nThey spent less than $3 billion on buybacks between January and September last year, with none in the third quarter, after spending nearly $70 billion on repurchases over the previous four years (almost $52 billion of that was in 2020 and 2021.)\n\nRamping up stock sales and curbing buybacks helped to nearly double Berkshire's cash pile in nine months from $168 billion to a record $325 billion (or $310 billion after subtracting almost $15 billion of payables for Treasury bill purchases in the third quarter).\n\nBerkshire's cash pile now exceeds the total value of the company just over a decade ago and accounted for a hefty 27% of its $1.15 trillion of assets at the end of September.\n\nBuffett and his colleagues have said they're stacking cash because they're struggling to find bargains with valuations at historic highs, and they don't mind keeping money out of an ebullient stock market.\n\n4. Selling sacred cows\n\nBuffett and his investment managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, made several striking changes to Berkshire's stock portfolio last year.\n\nThey pared Apple, their largest position, by 67% in nine months, reducing its value from $174 billion to below $70 billion. The sharp reduction shocked many as Buffett had showered praise on the iPhone maker for years, hailing it as \"probably the best business I know in the world\" and one of Berkshire's \"four giants.\"\n\nBuffett and his deputies also cut Bank of America, their No. 2 position, by about 26% between mid-July and mid-October, collecting more than $10 billion of proceeds. The sales lowered their stake from above 13% to below 10%, freeing them from having to disclose changes to the holding within a couple of days. Their stake only dropped in value from $35 billion to $32 billion between January and September because the bank's stock price rose by about a fifth during that period.\n\nBerkshire also revealed a near-$7 billion stake in the insurer Chubb in its first-quarter portfolio update, trimmed holdings such as Capital One in the second quarter, and bought nearly 4% of Domino's Pizza in the third quarter while cutting several smaller holdings.\n\n5. Giving billions\n\nBuffett donated Berkshire shares worth $5.3 billion to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four of his family's foundations in June.\n\nHe said those gifts meant he'd given $55 billion to the quintet over the previous 18 years, based on how much the Berkshire shares were worth at the time of giving.\n\nBuffett divvied up a further $1.2 billion stock donation among the four family foundations in late November, continuing a Thanksgiving tradition he started in 2022.\n\nThe latest donations reduced his number of A shares to a little more than 206,000, meaning he's given away almost 57% of his shares since pledging 99% of them to good causes in 2006.\n\n6. Estate planning\n\nBuffett unexpectedly published a near-1,500-word letter to shareholders alongside the news of his Thanksgiving gift.\n\nIn it, he reiterated his desire to pass along his incredible wealth to \"others who were given a very short straw at birth.\"\n\nBuffett disclosed earlier in the year that he planned to put almost his entire fortune in a trust and task his three children with distributing it to worthy causes after he dies. But in his mini letter in November, he acknowledged that his kids are in their late 60s and early 70s and might die before they can fulfill his vision.\n\nThe investor said that risk had led him to designate three potential successor trustees to be \"on the waitlist\" just in case.\n\nBuffett also took stock of the astounding scale of wealth in America, where more than a dozen people, including him, are personally worth in excess of $100 billion.\n\n\"It has been mind-blowing — beyond the imaginations of Ford, Carnegie, Morgan or even Rockefeller,\" he wrote. \"Billions became the new millions.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

    "text": "The booming U.S. stock market will help keep the dollar expensive as global investors pour money into America, a foreign exchange strategist said. But the politics of any trade deals that the incoming Trump administration might negotiate are a wild card.\n\nThe dollar surged against global currencies last year and looks to remain strong in 2025 if global investors continue pouring money into the booming U.S. stock market, according to Societe Generale chief foreign exchange strategist Kit Juckes.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg TV on Thursday, he said the neutral interest rate—the level that neither speeds up nor slows down an economy—is higher in the U.S. than in Europe.\n\n\"If my neutral rate is higher than your neutral rate, my currency ought to be going up forever,\" Juckes explained. \"It's not a stable equilibrium, if we have these big divergences in neutral policy rate.\"\n\nBut that disparity is largely priced into the dollar already, he added. In recent months, the greenback has been lifted by the Federal Reserve signaling fewer rate cuts in the coming year as the economy chugs along, inflation remains sticky, and policies from President-elect Donald Trump are expected to add upward pressure on prices.\n\nBy contrast, top economies in Europe are faltering, and analysts expect the European Central Bank to cut rates more aggressively. China's slowing growth is also spurring policymakers there to roll out more easing measures.\n\nWhile the economics of the global currency market are clear, politics represent a wild card, Juckes said. Trump's vow to impose across-the-board tariffs, which could result in trade deals, are key.\n\nIn his view, any deal that helps the U.S. would also have to be good for global trade, which would improve growth outside the U.S. and weigh on the dollar.\n\nAt the margins, politics will be more important than straight-ahead economics, but from a strictly economic perspective, the dollar will remain strong for the foreseeable future, he said.\n\n\"It's a really expensive currency that will stay expensive as long as the rest of the world is shoveling all of its savings into the United States to see how much money it can make out of the U.S. equity market,\" Juckes predicted.\n\nThat echoes recent warnings about so-called American exceptionalism, which is marked by U.S. dominance in global markets.\n\nLast month, Ruchir Sharma, chair of Rockefeller International, said \"the mother of all bubbles\" in the U.S. is sucking money away from the rest of the world.\n\n\"Thoroughly dominating the mind space of global investors, America is over-owned, overvalued, and overhyped to a degree never seen before,\" he said in a Financial Times column.\n\nAnd in November, Allianz chief economic advisor Mohamed El-Erian told Bloomberg TV to expect a \"huge sucking sound\" of foreign capital flooding into the U.S.\n\nThe rest of the world may have more trouble coping with a period of faster growth and hotter inflation, adding to America's relative edge, he warned.\n\n\"This is a period in which U.S. dominance of the global system is going to increase, both for positive reasons and for negative reasons in the short term,\" El-Erian said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Italy is in advanced talks with Elon Musk’s SpaceX for a deal to provide secure telecommunications for the nation’s government — the largest such project in Europe, people with knowledge of the matter said Sunday.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNYC’s Subway Violence Deters Drive to Bring Workers Back to Office\n\nNYC Condo Owners May Bear Costs of Landmark Green Building Law\n\nDutch Central Bank Restores Amsterdam’s ‘Ugliest Building’\n\nCan American Drivers Learn to Love Roundabouts?\n\nCan States Hit the Brakes on Runaway Roadbuilding?\n\nDiscussions are ongoing, and a final agreement on the five-year contract hasn’t been reached, said the people, who asked not to be identified citing confidential discussions. The project has already been approved by Italy’s Intelligence Services as well as Italy’s Defense Ministry, they said.\n\nItaly on Monday confirmed discussions are ongoing, saying no deal had yet been reached. “The talks with SpaceX are part of normal government business,” the government said.\n\nThe negotiations, which had stalled until recently, appeared to move forward after Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni visited President-elect Donald Trump in Florida on Saturday. The Italian government said the two didn’t discuss the issue during their meeting.\n\nItalian officials have been negotiating on a €1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) deal aimed at supplying Italy with a full range of top-level encryption for telephone and Internet services used by the government, the people said.\n\nThe plan also includes communications services for the Italian military in the Mediterranean area as well as the rollout of so-called direct-to-cell satellite services in Italy for use in emergencies like terror attacks or natural disasters, they said.\n\nThe possible deal has been under review since mid-2023. It’s been opposed by some Italian officials concerned about how the services may detract from local carriers.\n\nRepresentatives from SpaceX didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment made outside regular business hours.\n\nIn 2024 alone, Musk’s SpaceX has added more than 20 nations from Ghana to Argentina to its Starlink satellite Internet service. It now serves more than 4 million people in 100-plus countries and territories, blanketing the globe with broadband services, pushing out legacy telecom operators and outpacing fresh challenges from Amazon.com Inc. and nation-state rivals such as China.\n\nLate last year, Kyivstar PJSC, Ukraine’s largest mobile operator, signed a deal with Starlink to introduce satellite-powered cellular service in a bid to place telecom infrastructure beyond the reach of Russian attacks.\n\nSpaceX offers its Starlink service for commercial applications ranging from residential internet service to maritime shipping and airlines, and is also developing a product called Starshield for defense and sensitive uses.\n\nIt’s conquering the global satellite communications market thanks to a powerful mix of technology leaps and shrewd business maneuvering, as well as Musk’s growing political clout.\n\nItaly is one of the world’s most competitive markets for phone carriers, which have been struggling for years with shrinking profits. The local industry is facing a fresh round of mergers as well as multi-billionaire asset disposals.\n\nLast year Telecom Italia SpA, the country’s former phone monopoly, sold its landline network to the US private equity firm KKR & Co. in a €22 billion deal with the goal of slashing its debt pile. The grid sale was the first of its kind for a European phone company, and it was strongly backed by Meloni government.\n\nItaly considers telecommunications as a strategic asset.\n\nThe government holds stakes in both Telecom Italia and in the new KKR-owned phone network company called FiberCop. In addition, Italy controls FiberCop’s smaller rival Open Fiber.\n\nItaly is among the countries already serviced by Starlink, which delivers broadband Internet through its network of more than 7,000 SpaceX satellites. Last year, Starlink claimed that Telecom Italia was obstructing the rollout of its high-speed Internet services.\n\nThe Italian government was reviewing alternatives to Musk’s Starlink option, including the EU’s Satellite Constellation Company IRIS² as well as building its own satellite constellation, the people said. In both cases, the projects’ cost would have outpaced €10 billion.\n\nIn his first term, Trump often portrayed himself on the world stage as a sort of salesman-in-chief for American business interests. He often used high-level meetings with counterparts to secure commitments to buy US arms or invest in US factories.\n\n--With assistance from Eric Johnson and Gregory Korte.\n\n(Updates with Italian government statement from third paragraph.

    "text": "Bill Gates is turning heads again, but not for anything tech-related. While Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains his largest holding (about $15.4 billion) in the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation portfolio, Gates has been making some surprising moves.\n\nOver the past year, he sold nearly a quarter of his Microsoft stock, but his bold third-quarter buys have everyone talking. Gates put his money into two transportation companies, signaling he's betting big on an industry bounce-back.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIt’s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $70 million in art — this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%. Here’s how everyday investors are getting started.\n\nInspired by Uber and Airbnb – Deloitte's fastest-growing software company is transforming 7 billion smartphones into income-generating assets – with $1,000 you can invest at just $0.26/share!\n\nThe S&P 500 Transportation Index had a tough 2024, slipping 0.5% while the overall S&P 500 soared 23%. But Gates seems to see opportunity in the midst of it all.\n\nAccording to market analysts, his two picks – Paccar and FedEx – reflect a belief that the sector is poised for a turnaround, especially if the economy improves in 2025. These strategic buys are worth a closer look.\n\nPaccar (NASDAQ:PCAR) might not ring a bell, but it’s heavy in heavy-duty trucks. The company's Peterbilt and Kenworth brands command 14.9% and 14.7% of the U.S. Class 8 truck market, second only to Freightliner's dominant 36.5% share, as reported by ATD.\n\nSee Also: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\n\nThese massive trucks, weighing over 33,000 pounds, are critical to the economy and Paccar's performance reflects that.\n\nPaccar had a strong start to 2024, with a quarterly revenue of $8.74 billion in the first quarter. But as truckload demand dipped, the momentum faded. Still, signs of a recovery are emerging. Kenny Vieth, president of ACT Research, told Transport Topics, \"We're in the early stages of building 2025 backlogs and November orders were up 21% from October.\"\n\nGates scooped up one million Paccar shares at around $100 each, a $100 million investment in a company he believes has long-term promise.\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nThen there's FedEx (NYSE:FDX), a logistics powerhouse navigating turbulence. Its third-quarter report fell short of expectations and the company revised its full-year forecast downward, unsettling investors. But Gates saw an opportunity, snapping up another one million shares at an average of $273 each.\n\nFedEx has been shaking things up internally. The company announced plans to spin off its less-than-truckload freight division, FedEx Freight, into a stand-alone business. According to Bloomberg, this division pulled in $9.4 billion in 2023 and could become a growth driver as FedEx sharpens its focus on core operations.\n\nThe move is part of its broader DRIVE initiative, which aims to make the company more efficient and flexible. Analysts believe this will streamline FedEx's operations and position it for growth if the economy rebounds.\n\nRead Next:\n\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

    "text": "By Jamie McGeever\n\n(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.\n\nThe first full trading week of 2025 kicks off in Asia on Monday with the sharp slide in China's currency and bond yields, an increasingly tense and fluid political situation in South Korea and a blocked U.S.-Japanese corporate merger all vying for investors' attention.\n\nA raft of purchasing managers index reports is also on deck, offering investors the first glimpse into how many of Asia's biggest economies, including China's, closed out 2024.\n\nThe global market backdrop looks relatively bright after Friday's rebound on Wall Street, and equity and bond market volatility seems well-contained.\n\nBut emerging market currencies and assets are on the defensive, thanks to elevated U.S. Treasury yields and a soaring dollar. The greenback softened a bit on Friday, but it hit a fresh two-year high the day before and has rallied almost 10% in the last three months.\n\nMuch of the dollar's appeal comes from the surge in long-dated U.S. Treasury yields since the Fed began cutting interest rates in September. The central bank's 100 basis points of easing has been met with a rise of 100 bps in the 10-year yield, a remarkable turn of events that has bamboozled most investors - and likely policymakers too.\n\nThe picture in China could not be more different. As investors position for a year of policy easing and liquidity provision from Beijing, the yuan and bond yields are coming under heavy downward pressure.\n\nAttention is focusing on the short end of the Chinese curve, with the two-year yield on the brink of breaking below 1.00%. It is already the lowest on record, having tumbled 50 bps in the last two months and 100 bps since last March. The psychological 1.00% barrier could break on Monday.\n\nIn this context, Chinese inflation data later this week will take on even greater significance, and a Reuters poll suggests annual consumer inflation in December held steady at 0.2%. Although China's economic surprises index has been rising in recent weeks, markets will be highly sensitive to added deflationary pressures.\n\nThe spot yuan on Friday slid to a four-month low, breaking through the 7.30 per dollar level that the People's Bank of China had appeared to be defending. A move through 7.35 per dollar would signal a fresh 17-year low.\n\nSelling pressure on the yuan looks pretty strong, as evidenced by the spread between the spot dollar/yuan rate and the central bank's daily fixing. It is now the widest since last July, hovering around its widest levels on record.\n\nAre authorities in Beijing getting nervous? The central bank on Friday warned fund managers against slamming bond yields even lower, amid worries that a bubble in bonds might undercut Beijing's efforts to revive growth and manage the yuan.\n\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Monday:\n\n- China, Japan, India, Australia services PMIs (December)\n\n- Thailand inflation (December)\n\n- Vietnam GDP (Q4)\n\n(Reporting by Jamie McGeever; editing by Diane Craft)",

    "text": "A recent Supreme Court ruling may slow down President-elect Donald Trump's deregulation plans.\n\nThe overturning of the Chevron doctrine in June limits federal agencies' power.\n\nDeregulation delays could disappoint investors who've been pricing in less red tape since Trump's win.\n\nA recent Supreme Court decision could hinder one of the stock market's biggest reasons for rallying around Donald Trump's coming second term in office.\n\nTrump's election win in November excited Wall Street over the idea that a wave of deregulation was set to unleash gains for American businesses.\n\nBut the Supreme Court's June decision to overturn the so-called Chevron doctrine could hinder the Trump administration's deregulatory agenda, strategists at Carson Group said this week.\n\nThe Chevron doctrine was a decadeslong legal precedent dating back to 1984 that empowered federal government agencies to interpret laws when legislation passed by Congress was ambiguous.\n\nThe Supreme Court's precedent, set during the Ronald Reagan administration, was that courts should defer to the agencies rather than make their own judgment in such instances.\n\nBut since the precedent was overturned in June, courts are now dismissing federal agencies' interpretations of ambiguous laws.\n\nThis was on full display earlier this week when the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down net-neutrality rules.\n\nThe three-judge panel specifically highlighted the downfall of the Chevron doctrine in their ruling.\n\n\"Unlike past challenges that the D.C. Circuit considered under Chevron, we no longer afford deference to the FCC's reading of the statute,\" the decision said.\n\nBarry Gilbert, an investment strategist at Carson Group, said in a note on Friday that the Chevron doctrine was initially supported by conservative justices in 1984 \"because it made deregulation easier.\"\n\n\"Overturning Chevron was great (from a Republican perspective) when Democrats are in power, but it also makes deregulation more difficult, which is why the original Chevron case went to the Supreme Court in the first place,\" Gilbert said.\n\nWith Republicans set to hold a trifecta of power in the White House and both chambers of Congress later this month, the overturning of the Chevron doctrine could come back to bite them when it comes to enacting policies aimed at loosening regulations for the private sector, Gilbert said.\n\n\"Some efforts to lighten regulatory requirements are likely to be met with waves of litigation that may take years to work their way through the court system,\" Gilbert said.\n\nWhat could have been swift deregulation policies enacted by President-elect Trump could now take much longer to play out as lawsuits inevitably make their way before the courts.\n\n\"We are worse off than the Reagan administration was before the Chevron ruling, because courts will be drawn into the messy process of delineating exactly what the new ruling means,\" Gilbert said.\n\nIn a December note, UBS said that after the overturning of the Chevron doctrine, certain efforts to cut spending could also be impeded.\n\n\"The ruling also makes it harder to cut spending in areas that are well-defined in legislation,\" UBS said.\n\nUBS said that could impact the efforts of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, which seeks to significantly shrink the footprint of federal agencies. Eliminating entire agencies such as the Department of Education would require 60 votes in the Senate.\n\nWhile deregulation is still on the table during Trump's second administration, it could ultimately happen much slower than during his first administration, which could set the stock market up for disappointment.\n\n\"It may make deregulation under the new Trump administration less robust than markets expect in places,\" Gilbert said.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- TDK Corp., one of the main suppliers of batteries for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, will this year roll out an improved version of its most advanced product to help mobile devices keep up with the rising power demands of built-in AI.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNYC’s Subway Violence Deters Drive to Bring Workers Back to Office\n\nDutch Central Bank Restores Amsterdam’s ‘Ugliest Building’\n\nCan American Drivers Learn to Love Roundabouts?\n\nNYC Condo Owners May Bear Costs of Landmark Green Building Law\n\nCan States Hit the Brakes on Runaway Roadbuilding?\n\nThe Tokyo-based company plans to start mass production of its third-generation silicon-anode cells from late summer, Chief Executive Officer Noboru Saito said in an interview. Silicon batteries, which are more complex to manufacture but carry more energy than conventional ones, have already been embraced by most major Chinese phone makers and Saito sees further growth ahead.\n\n“Our continued investment in R&D is one of our business’s strengths, and we plan to accelerate that momentum,” said the 58-year-old executive, who’s been with the company for over three decades.\n\nHong Kong-based subsidiary Amperex Technology Ltd., the leading provider of mobile batteries globally, first introduced lithium-ion cells with silicon anodes in 2023 after years of research and fine-tuning. Those had 5% greater energy density than graphite-anode batteries, and the improvement has steadily risen to 15% better capacity in the upcoming 2025 edition. That’s resulted in devices like the recent Vivo X200 Pro, which is the same size and weight as phones that have 5,000 milliampere-hours of capacity but includes a 6,000mAh cell.\n\nThe potential of silicon batteries has also been recognized by TDK rivals LG Energy Solution Ltd. and Samsung SDI Co., both of which are developing such products for use in electric vehicles. TDK and ATL’s silicon anode provider, US-based Group14 Technologies Inc., counts Porsche AG as a strategic investor and sees EVs as the next frontier for the technology after smartphones.\n\n“Virtually all the automakers are looking at silicon batteries” because of their potentially much faster charging times, Group14 CEO Rick Luebbe said in an interview. Silicon car batteries could recharge in five to seven minutes where existing ones using graphite need 40 minutes or more, he added.\n\nTDK is investing in capacity as well as continued research and development, Saito said. He sees the company’s advantage in its speed to mass production and ATL’s expertise in putting the various elements together. TDK is currently the only company capable of mass-producing silicon batteries, according to Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda, because of the complexity of assembling them at scale. That’s a big advantage for the company, but not for its customers.\n\n“A component that only one company can make causes supply shortage concerns among clients, and that often blocks the wide adoption of that technology,” Yasuda cautioned.\n\nWhile the silicon-anode segment of TDK’s business is still small, Saito is confident that customers will see value in the technology and growth will come “step by step.”\n\n--With assistance from Vlad Savov and Heejin Kim.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat Happens When TikTok’s Trend Machine Shuts Down?\n\nLuxury Brands Need to Get Over Their Youth Fixation to Offset Drag From Trump’s Tariffs\n\nThe US’s Worst Fears of Chinese Hacking Are on Display in Guam\n\nThe US Government Is Sitting on a Possible Solution to the Housing Crisis\n\nMusk Tries to Pick a Fight with the UK\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.",
